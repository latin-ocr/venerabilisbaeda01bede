Monastic
Scribes.

XX Introduction. [PART Ι.

But ,Ta-rrow had not, like some larger ancl later monas-
teries ¹, a great scriptorium with a staff of trained copyists ².
In the Preface to his St. Luke, Bede expressly says that,
in addition to the various ties of his monastic duties, he had
to be his own amanuensis, shorthand writer, and copyist 3.

It illustrates the difficulties under which these tasks were ·

carried on in those northern climes, that Cuthbert, Abbot
of WVearmouth and J arrow in the second half of the eighth
century, excuses himself to Lullus, the successor of St.
Boniface as Archbishop of Mainz, for not having sent him

¹ The school of St. Martin’s,
Tours, under Alcuin was of great
importance, for it was there that
the special hand known as the
Caroline minuscule received its
development. Maunde Thomp·
son, Palaeography, pp. 233, 234.
Seligenstadt was also famous,
D. A. C. ii. 1857. So was Orleans,
an episcopal, not a monastic
school. ib. Cf. the following
description of the scriptorium
of St. Martin’s at Tournai: ‘si
claustrum ingredereris, uideres
plerumque xii monachos iuue-
nes in cathedris sedentes, et
super tabulas diligenter et arti-
ficiose compositas cum silentio
scribentesss' Pertz, u. s. Then
follows a list of books copied,
including several works of Bede.
Abbot Odo himself ‘ multociens
integro mense de claustro non
exibat, sed . . . scribendis libris
totum studium dabat! ib. Cf.
at St. Hubert in the Ardennes :
‘ Gislebertum . . . in scribendis
et renouandis libris studiosum.'
Pe1·tz,viii.570—573. Cf.ib.xiv.31 1.

In Britain the two chiefcentres
of scribal activity were Lindis-
farne and Canterbury. In the
latter the influence was Italian;
in the former it was Irish, derived

from Iona and giving rise to a
national hand. For the Lindis-
farne Gospels, the noblest pro-
duction of this school, see on V.
12. It shows the high devotion
of these scribes3 on which cf.
D. C. A. ii. 1013. For an inter-
esting notice of an Irish scribe,
Ultan, in a Northumbrian mo-
nastery, see Ethelwulf ‘de
Abbatibus,' in S. D. i. 274.

2 Nuns as well as monks acted
ascopyists 3 D. C.A.ii. 1413. St.
Boniface writes to Eadburg, ab·
bess of Thanet ε ‘deprecor ut . . .
mihi cum auro conscribas epis-
tolas domini mei Sancti Petri?

pumice for erasure. Cf. Opp.
xii. 342.

³ ‘Ipse mihi dictator simul
notarius et librarius? Opp. x,
268. Cf. D. C. A. ii. 988, 1403.

ter, υ. Opp. Min. p. 178. The

dorus on the Psalms and a frag·

handwriting. Pal. Soc. Platc
