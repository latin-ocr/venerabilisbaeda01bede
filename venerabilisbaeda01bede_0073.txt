very near to throwing over the literal sense entirely, as
when he says that the Song of Songs ‘nil carnale ct iuxta
literam resonet ¹.'

The allegorical method has lost much of its credit.
To us it seems an arbitrary and subjective process
whereby anything may be made to mean anything,
according to the taste and fancy of the expositor. And
seeing that Bede expressly lays down that the interpreta-
tion may go by contraries, good meaning bad, and bad
good⁴²; that the same persons and things may typify
different things at different times ³, and that the order of
events in the type and its fulfilment may be reversed⁴3
it is obvious what scope is left for the play of the subjec-
tive imagination 3 and we 0311 readily understand that, as
Bede says, 3 single line may contain matter for many

pages ⁵. But though seemingly arbitrary, the method has
its fixed laws and rules, ‘leges tropologiae ⁶,’ ‘leges alle·
goriae ⁷,' or ‘regulae allegoriae 8.'
