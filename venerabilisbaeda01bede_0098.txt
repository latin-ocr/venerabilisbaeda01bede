Plan of the
present
edition.

lxxxiv Ire troduction. [PAR-r 11.

ξ 21. Before proceeding to describe the MSS. of Bede,
it will be well to give some account of the plan of this
edition. The text is based 011 a complete collation of the
four oldest known MSS: viz. Μ, Β, Ο, N. Of these M
has so far been taken as the basis, that all deviations
from its text are noted, except in the case of mere varia-
tions of orthography, and even of these the more impor-
tant are registered. References to the folios of M are
placed in the margin. Of the other three MSS. such
readings are cited in the notes as seemed of impor'cance,
either intrinsically‚ or as illustrating the relationship
between the MSS. Ι have tried in all cases, where a MS.
has been altered, to distinguish the original from later
hands by a number placed above the symbol which
indicates the MS. in question. Thus N¹‚ N2, indicate the
first and second hands respectively in the Namur MS.
<A number placed helom a symbol indicates that the MS.
is one of several belonging to the same place or collec-
tion. Thus the Harleian MSS. referred to are cited as
H„ H2, &c.; the Oxford MSS. as Ol, Οἳ, Sec.) In regard
to proper names I have, except ·in one or two cases of
obvious blundel-s which are specially noted, always
retained in the text the spelling of Μ, and have given
in the notes the variations of all the other three MSS,
Thus text and notes together will give a complete view

of the various modes of spelling Anglo-Saxon names in
four MSS. of the eighth century‘¹. In regard to the

has been corrected throughout
by a scribe, who had either C
or a sister MS. to C before him
(see below, p. xci). To quote
these corrections as the readings
of B would give the impression
that B and C were in most
cases in exact agreement. As
a matter of fact they represent
two different recensions of the
text. Of Lumby and Mayor

I have used the third edition,

was published in 1879.
