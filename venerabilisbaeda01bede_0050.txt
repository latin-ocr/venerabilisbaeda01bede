Bede 011

the duty of
Pastors and

Masters.

xxxvi Introduction. [PART 1.

Of the duty of a pastor and a prelate Bede has a high
conception ¹. Those who are eminent in rank should be
eminent in goodness also 2. Again and again in his
theological works does Bede insist that the teacher must
first practise what he would have his pupils learn, that
the life must not contradict the lore 3. Again and again
in his history does he see in this the secret of the success
of the early apostles, prelates, and saints of the Church in
Britain, Gregory, Augustine, Laurentius, Aidan, Tuda,
Chad, Wilfrid, Boisil, Ethelthryth, Cuthbert, Eadbert,
Egbert4. And the life of Alcuin, assuredly with truth,
notes this as being characteristic of Bede himself, that

‘whatever he taught by word, he confirmed by his

example 5.'
