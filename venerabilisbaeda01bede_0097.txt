5 20.-] The Ma nuserlpts. lxxxiii

In 1878 Professor-s Mayor and Lumby mado a new Mnys›1-=1n·1
departure by publishing Books iii and iv of the Eccl.1¹¹¹¹¹¹¹'³'·
Hist. from the Moore MS. with occasional readings
from certain other Cambridge MSS. It is not possible,
as I shall show, to base a satisfactory text on M alone;
but apart from this fact, the readings of M are not always

correctly given ¹.

iv. 17, p. 240, l. 16:

nono. Suscepimus. Smith. Stev„ M. H. B.
nono suscepimus. Giles, Hussey, Mob„ Holder.

iv. 29. p. 275, l. 15:

diuina. Smith, Stev., Husscy, M. H.B., Mob.

diutina. Holder.
¹ Thus we have :—

L. 81 M. MS.
iii. 5, p. 28, l. 12. indomabiles -lis
iii. 6, l. 29, p. 6. domino deo
iii. 18 adfin„ p. 52, l. 21. praedecessor prodecessores
iii. 20, p. 58, l. 2. subtracto protracto
iv. 16, p. 121, l. 14. erat eatenus erat
iv. 22, p. 133, l. 28. suis sui
iv. 24, p. 142, l. 17. adstitit adstitit enim
iv. 3ο acl fin„ p. 159⁷ l. 21. commodum commemorandum

Even if the reading of L. δε
Μ. is in some cases the right
one. the divergence from the
standard MS. should be noted.
One very great drawback to the
value of L. δε M.’s edition is
that they have omitted, as a rule,
to distinguish between the ori-
ginal and later hands in M. To
give as the text of an eighth-
century MS.. readings which
may be the work of correctors
Ι two or more centuries later, is
to falsify the evidence. Of this
a crucial instance can be given.
In the capitulum of iii. 28, M,
by an obvious blunder (silemly
corrected by L. <Sc M.)‚ has
‘ orientales ’ for ‘ occidentales '

QSaxones). It had originally

the same blunder in the text
(L. St M. p. 82, 1. 5), but by
erasure and insertion ‘orien-
talium’ has been altered into
‘occidentalium’ Now Harl.
4978 (H.) is, as I shall show,
a tenth-century transcript of M,
and it reads ‘orient-⁹ not only
in the capitulum, but also in
the text3 ί. e. the correction in
M was not made till after the
transcription-of H„ ι’. e. at least
two centuries later. Yet L. &
Μ. give it as the reading of M.
See the present edition, pp. 194,
195, and notes. For another
example see p. 169, note 5.
Again, it sometimes happens
that one MS. has been revised
by means of another. Thus B
