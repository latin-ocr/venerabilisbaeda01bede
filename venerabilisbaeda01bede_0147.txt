relations of this version to the original do not concern us
here. They are matters for an editor os that version.
The only question with which an editor of the Latin
text is concerned is the bearing of the Anglo-Saxon
version on that text. Owing to the freedom with which
the translator worked, the AS. version is very rai-clv
available for the settlement- of minute differences of
reading. But the general type of text used by the
translator is perfectly plain. Owing to the omission of
the chronological summary, test 4 cannot be applied3
but the other four tests show that he used a MS. of the
C-type. And it was a good and pure MS. of that type.
The As. version shows no trace either of the unauthorised
additions of later Mss„ or of the special peculiarities of
the Durham or Winchester group. Other points in
which it shows its affinity with C are the joining together
of iii. 1 and 2, and the reading ‘unum quod ² for ‘quae-
dam quae’ at- the end of iv. 28 (30). In one or two
points the translator’s MS. was superior to our O 3 it did
not omit ‘signando ' at the end of iv. 22 (24), or ‘rationis ²
at the end of v. 21. It differs from O and the majority
of C’s followers, and agrees with M in making iii. 13
begin, ‘Nec solum inclyti fama uiri‚’ instead of ‘Tempore‚
inquit, mortalitatis ' ; but other MSS„ not of the M-type‚
do the same.
