ii Editor’s Prefcoee.

acquiesce in inevitable ignorance‚ and how far they
are merely inferences ultimately derived from Bede
himself. In the first 6666 they deserve careful con-
sideration, in the second they may be summarily set
aside‚ in the third case we must judge of their validity
as we would of any modern historica] theory. In
some instances these mediaeval writers may have
been better placed than we are for forming a correct
opinion, but as a rule ‘they would have no real ad-
vantage over us modernS‚ while they were without
many of our methods and appliances’ (Sanday‚
Bampton LectureS‚ p. 240). Yet statementS‚ obviously
of this inferential kind, are constantly quoted as if
they had the value of independent authorities. To
some of these cases attention is drawn in the notes,

In the notes I have brought together what I could
from other sources to illustrate the historical, social,
and ecclesiastica] bearings of Bede's text. Most of
these sources are, of course, obvious enough. My
special studies have enabled me to add some less
obvious illustrations from Celtic and Scandinavian
sources, One important source of illustration has
ι been almost wholly neglected by previous editors
I mean the other writings of Bede himself. Yet
apart from the numerous direct illustrations of the ’
text which they supply, the whole texture of Bede’s
thought, the whole tone and temper of his mind, is
so consistent, that we can hardly judge even his his-
torica] works aright, without some knowledge of his
other writings‚ especially of his theological works.
To attempt to judge of Bede merely as an historian
is inevitably to misjudge him. In history and in
science, as well as in theology‚ he is before all things
the Christian thinker and student.
