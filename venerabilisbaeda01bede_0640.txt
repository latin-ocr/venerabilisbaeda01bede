ADDITIONAL ORITIOAL NOTES.

 

The object of these additional Critical Notes is mainly to

Brittania, passus est sub eo eiusdem insulae incola? The object
of all these changes is to make the passage more suitable for

public reading ; and this explanation should be borne in mind
in all similar cases.

at that point in the MS. in question. By D* is meant the Durham
group of MSS.; and by W* the Winchester group.
