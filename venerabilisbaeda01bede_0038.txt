his plan.

The influence of Bede as a teacher extended far
beyond those countrymen, whom* he primarily desired
to benefit. His pupil, Archbishop Egbert, founded the
famous school of York. In that school was trained
Alcuin, who at the Court of Charles the Great largely
founded the Frankish system of educat-ion ². st, Boniface

of Bede as ‘shining like a candle of the Church, by his

who would be able to take part to any great extent in

Bede’s intellectual tasks5.

Bedemakesnoacknowledgement
of the large amount which he
borrows in the first book of the
H.E. from Orosius (i. 2⁴6, 8-11),
Gildas l i. 8, 12-16, 221, and Con-
stantius’ Life of Germanus (i.
17-21). The account of St.Alban
is evidently taken from some
‘Passion' which has not yet
been discovered. Bede acknow-
ledges his obligation to the Life
of st. Fursa in iii. 193 and to
that of St. Etlielberg, iv. 7—10.
The latter is not known to exist.
