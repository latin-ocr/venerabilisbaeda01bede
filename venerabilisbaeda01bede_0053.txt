(these names are probably due
to the fact that in the longer
work a universal chronicle is
embodied; cf. ‘testante Beda

where the reference is to Opp.

the longer work De Temporibus

highly considered. Marianus
Scotus speaks of their author as
‘Beda Computator.’ Pertz, v.
544, 546, so Fl. Wig: ‘com-
putator mirabilis,' i. 53. Cf. the
following curious entry in a
