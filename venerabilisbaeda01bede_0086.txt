lxxii Introduction. [PART 1.

fortunately a description from the pen of an eye-witness,
Outhbert, afterwards Abbot of Wearmouth and J arrow,
a description not inferior in beauty and pathos to any of
Bede’s own. Ι give it here in its entirety ¹.

‘' To Cuthwin, his dearest fellow-lector ‘² in Christ, Cuth-
bert, a co-disciple‚ eternal health in God.

‘The gift which thou sentest Ι have received with great
pleasure7 and have also read with much satisfaction thy
devout and learned letter, from which Ι was glad to find
that masses and sacred prayers are diligently celebrated
by you for our master Bede, that father beloved of, God.
VVherefore Ι am pleased, rather for the love of him, than
for any skill of mine, to tell thee in a few words the

1173 iv. 33 v. 546; Χ. 17. Thus
the earliest northern authorities
are in favour of 735, and this is
important. In view of the un-
certainty of reading in Cuth-
bert’s letter as to the day of the
month on which Bede died, and
the proverbial uncertainty of
numerals in MSS. Ι cannot at-
tach much value to the argument
of Messrs. Luniby and Mayor
that he died 111 742. Hen.
Hunt, u. s., says that Bede was
in his sixty-second year when
he died3 this would give 7343
for Bede himself says he was
in his fifty-ninth year in 731.
But this may be only Hen.
Hunt's inference from that pas-
sage combined with his own
date of 734. I have already
exposed Sim. Dun.’s error in
saying that Bede was only fifty-
nine when he died. Above, p.
xi. The Vita Alcuini errs 111
the other direction when it
says: ‘migrauit ad Dominum
nonagenarius! Pertz, xv. 187.

² The original 15 given 111 an

Appendix. It is printed as
given by M. & L. from a ninth-
cent. MS. at St. Gallen. In the
notes are given the variations
of the text as ordinarily printed.
It will be seen that the varia-
tions are very considerable. For
a list of other MSS. see Hardy‚
Cat. i. 455, 456; M. & L. p.
399. I have not attempted to
collate the various MSS.; and
therefore I have no theory to
propound with reference to the
divergence of the texts.

² There is some doubt as to
the meaning of ‘ collectori ' here.
It cannot mean ‘ collector.’ To
take it with M. & L. as mean-
ing ‘fellow-student' creates
a rather poor tautology with
‘condiscipulus' which follows.
Ι am inclined to agree with
Mr. Τ. Arnold (S. D. i. 43) that
it means fellow-lector; i. e. both
Cuthbert and Cuthwine were at
this time in the second grade of
minor orders. ‘Lector’ also
means a teacher or lecturerin the
monastic schools, t. Ducange‚ sas.
