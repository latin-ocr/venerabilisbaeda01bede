Harley 3020 (110¹. This is a beautiful MS. of the Harlvym..
tenth century, Svo, 22·70><13·00‚ ff. 132. It containsfflff·
lives of saints, of which the three first articles concern
us here. (α) Bede's homily on Benedict Biscop, partly
printed from this MS. by Stevenson, Opp. Min. pp. 3 3 5-3 38
(cf. Opp. v. 179-185, a different text). (b) Bede's history
of the Abbots‚ ff. 7a—-21 a. (c) The anonymous history of
the Abbots„ ff. 2 1 a-34 a. This MS. furnishes by far the
oldest and best text of Bede's Hist. Abb., and it was
rightly made by Mr. Stevenson the basis of his edition
(Opp. Min. pp. 139-162). It is not mentioned by Hardy,
Cat. i. 413 3 though on 1110 preceding page he had cited it
as the only authority for the anonymous history of the
Abbots. Unfortunately there are two considerable lacunae
in it3 the first in ξ 18, from ‘qui a primis' to ‘commen-
dato—'3 the second in ἕξ 20—21, from ‘et in loco’ to
‘geminorum martyrum? The fact that in the former
case the lacuna ceases in the middle of a word ‘ com·
mendatoriam’ seems to show that these lacunae are due
not to ‘an oversight of the scribe' (Stevenson‚ pp. 158,
160), but 10 501110 mutilation of the MS. Which he had
before him. This MS. is on the whole very accurately
written. There are some mistakes in 113, mostly mere slipS‚
Which can be easily corrected, and Which have in most in-
stances been corrected by the scribe of the next MS ².
