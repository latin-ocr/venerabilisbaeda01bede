XXX Introduction.

[PART Ι.

ξ 9. The life where the monastic rule was strictly ob-
served must have been a very hard one. The influence
of the Irisli missionaries had impressed a strongly ascetic
character on the Northumbrian Church. Bede tells of an
Irish monk, named Adamnan⁷ in the monastery of Colding-
ham, who only touched food twice a week‚ on Sundays

and Thursdays ¹. Drythelm, the monk of Melrose,who had
the famous vision7 would stand up to his loins‚ or some-

times up to his neck, in the river Tweed, reciting prayers
and psalnis, even breaking the ice in winter to go in, and
letting his cold wet garments dry upon his body 2, and
Cuthbert is said to have done the same 3. There can
indeed be little doubt that Outhbert's mind was unhinged
by the austerities that he practised 4. Like some of the
wild Covenanters7 of whom Scott tells in Old Mortath,
he fancied that he had visible conflicts with the powers of
darkness ⁵. A story in Bede's life of him brings out the
hardness of this monastic life in a pathetic manner.

from Migne, Pat. Lat. lix. 564,

dam petebant aquam, in qua diu-
tius morando . . . omnem carnis
ardorem domitabant.' This was
also imposed as a penance : ‘ pro

the duty of not incapacitating
