given by those instances in Which the scribe of H¹ has
misinterpreted the reading of M. Thus, p. 2 53, M reads
‘ad 'calcariam 'ciuitatem qz- (quae)‚' meaning that ‘calc'
and ι01113 are to be transposed. H1 perceives this, but
mistaking ‘q:.' for the conjunction ‘que' transposes it
also, and reads ‘ciuitatemque calcariam‚' Which makes
nonsense. Again, in v. 24, annal 538: ‘eclipsis solis . . .
ab hora prima usque ad tertia1n,' M accidentally omits
‘solis,’ then adds it on the margin at the end of the line
with a mark of insertion after ‘eclipsis' Hl overlooks
this mark, and copying mechanically reads ε ‘eclipsis . . .
ab hora prima usque ad tertiam solis ²? (4) A further
proof of the connexion of the two MSS. is afforded by
the extracts which follow the H. E. These are identical
With those which occur at the end of Μ, as far as these
latter, Which are mutilated, go3 viz. Isidore on Con-
sanguinity‚ and the decree of Gregory II. And more than
this, they arc in the same leand. If any one will compare
the Palaeograpliical Society’s facsimile of the last page of
M <plate 140) With f. 149a of H1 3 or, if that be impossible,
with the facsimile of Η1 111 M. H. B. (plate xxvii), he
will be convinced of this, In other words, it was the
scribe of Hl who made these additions to M 3. After the

² On the other hand Hl makes
a certain number of slips and
omissions for Which M is not re-
sponsible 3 per contra, he has cor-
rected, generally quite rightly,
a number of M’s mistakes. Ι
have noticed about fifty cases in
which Hl differs from M; but
all may be accounted for in one
of these two ways. None of

them indicate the use of any
source besides M.

3 It is very interesting to not‹¹
that this same additional matter
from Isidore and Gregory II is
to be found in a MS. of Bcdc’s
Hist. Eccl. at Berne, Biblio-
theca Bongarsiana, No. 49. See
Hagen's Catalogue, p. 73. This
MS. is of the ninth ccnt., and
belonged to the great monastery
of Fleury. I have not seen it, but
