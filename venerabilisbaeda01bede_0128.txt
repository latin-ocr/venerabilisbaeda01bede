26·20 ¹, ff. 108. ‘Late tenth cent. Written in minuscules
generally of a continental type, but obviously by English
scribes. . . . On f. 40 is a marked change of hand ex-
tending over three columns only, the characters being
strongly English in form⁷ notably the -ν and 9. The last
scribe, apparently beginning at f. 83 b, was the AEdelelm
who wrote the colophon. A monk of this name appears
in the “Liber Vitae '' of Hyde Abbey (New Minster‘) early
in the eleventh cent. (ed. Birch, p. 138). . . . On f. 45 b, in
a hand of the fourteenth cent.7 is a note on the transla-

KVarner's courteous permission.

either of a scribe reproducing
an inscription in an older MS„
which he did not understand;
or of one who had a smattering
of Irish‚ and tried to imitate
the notes often made by Irish
scribes in the MSS. which they

Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady.
