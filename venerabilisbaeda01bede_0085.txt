§19·] Bcdc’s Life (mul Worlcs. lxxi
sation from fasting¹. Against one form of religious folly,
which is ever with us, the folly, namely, which would
seek, 111 defiance of Christ’s express command, to fix 1110
day and the hour of His second coming, Bedc is justly
severe ². ⁶

ξ 19. And now the time was coming when Bcdc was
to show forth in his own person, that which he had so
lovingly described in the case of others, the blcssedness of
a holy death. Already when 116 wrote the letter to Arch—
bishop Egbert in Nov. 734, he was ill, and unable to
keep his engagement with the Archbishop. And the end
was not very long in coming. There are difficulties as to

the year of Bede's death 3 the traditional date is 7 3 5, and

1 am disposed to adhere to it ³.

¹ Opp. X. 373 cf. xii. 58.

² Opp. xi. 25ο; vi. 332-334.
Some tried to evade the force of
this command by saying that
though Christ had forbidden us
to inquire ‘the day or the hour,'
he had not forbidden us to in-
quire the year. Opp. i. 151,
152. Of Bede’s views on vir-
ginity and marriage, which are
eminently sensible, and, with
one exception, scriptural, Ι have
spoken in the notes to H. E. 1.
27. In regard to the relation of
the active to the contemplative
life, Bede is also free from
mediaeval exaggerations. See
the notes to H. E. ii. 1. Ι can-
not see that we have any reason
to pride ourselves on our superior
wisdom, because on these points
we have gone to the opposite
extreme from that into which
the 'Middle Ages fell.

³ Some foreign chronicles
place his death in 730. PertZ,
i. 1143 ii. 221, 239. More place
it in 731. Ib. i. 24, 25, 64, 67,

Of his last hours we have

733 ii. 2815 iii. 1383 iv. 6, 12;
xv. 187, 1294. This date is pro-
bably due to a confusion between
the date of Bede⁷s death, and
the date of the completion of the
H. E. For the latter 731 is
correct. One chronicle places
Bede's death in 733 (Pertz, vi.
26), but the indiction points to
731. Any date earlier than 734
is inadmissible because of Ep.
ad Egb· §§ 13, 17, pp· 416, 423,
and notes. 734 is the date of
all MSS. of the Sax. Chron., of
the Ann. Ult., W. M. i. 58, G. P.
p. 385, R. W. i. 220, and probably
of Ethelwerd and H. H. p. 115.
Fl. Wig„ following the Chron.,
gives 734, but his own criteria
point to 735, and he himself 16-
gards this as the date indicated
in Cuthbert's letter, i. 53. 735
is the date of Cont. Bcd. infr.
p. 361 ; of S. D. i. 41, 224, 2283
and of the Ann. Lindisf„ Pertz,
xiX. 505. Two foreign autho·
rities give 736, Pertz, iii. 1533
v. 1; and four give 737, ib. iii.
