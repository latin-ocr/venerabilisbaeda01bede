§5·] Bede's Life (117ch Worlcsu xvii

Ceolfrid ¹, is inconsistent, not only with Bcdo's words cited
above, but with his total silence in all his works as to :my
such visit ἢ though in two of his works he tells us how in
701 certain of the brethren, of whom szrtbert was 0110,
were in Rome 011 a mission from Ceolfrid, and brought
back a privilege for the monastery from Pope Sergius ³³.

§5. We can form from Bede's own writings a very Monam-

fair idea of that monastic life to which he dedicated him-
self with such single-hearted devotion.
into the monastery at the age of seven he would be placed
no doubt in the monastic school ⁴. Besides his own
words as to the delight Which he took in learning, and
the evidence of his own W0rks‚ We have the testimony of
Alcuin to his diligence as a young student. In a letter
written to the monks of Wearmouth and Jarrow in 793
he urges their younger members loy the example of Bede
to be diligent in study and devotion, and not to spend

i. 62, 63; Stevenson, preface to
H. E. pp. x—xiii.

² S. D. i. 41, 227 expressly
says that he never crossed the
sea. All this of course does not
prove that he was not invited.
But even this is very doubtful.
See Werner, pp. 85, 86. The
conclusion of W. M. is: ‘quod
Romae fuerit solide non affirmo,
sed eum illuc inuitatum haud
dubie pronuntio‚' i. 62. See

⁴ See VVerner. pp. 28. 29, 82—
84, for this, and for the ordinary
subjects of study in such schooh,
cf. the various accounts that
exist of the schools at York
founded by Bode’s friend, arch-

Bede

bishop Egbert, e. g. Vita Alcuini,
Mon. Alc. pp. 9 ff. There is an
interesting account of the schools
opened by Alcuin at St. Martin’s
at Tours in a letter of his to
Charles the Great, ib. 344—348.
Somethnes monks might be
sent to another monastery to
be educated. Cf. a papal privi-
lege granted to the monastery
of St. Bertin, at St. Omer, in
the thirteenth century: ‘quod

chis nostris scolas teneat, et eos
doceat, et quod ad ho(- possimus
