MSS. Ι have not seen. Hl is cited once (p. 162), the
Phillipps MSS. once (p. 231), the Barlow MS. (z 010),
though not mentioned in the preface‚ is once cited
(p. 148), a citation which is borrowed from Smith (p. 78),

(pMobgrly (1869, reprinted 1881) says : ‘The text of the

Church History is that of Smith corrected in a few
places by that of M. H. B.’ (p. xix).

Holder in his handy editions of the text used no fresh
MS. material, though he utilised the work of pre-
vious editors, including Lumby and Mayor3 and he
introduced a theoretical orthography based on Bede’s
treatise De Orthographia, which is not that of any of
the MSS, and 15 not consistently carried out ¹.

¹ E. 9 we have ‘collocare ' and the following table, where some
‘conlocare' on the same page, obvious misprints and over-
p. 20, ‘languore ¹ and ‘langore ⁹ sights of Smith are given which
p. 225, ‘fulgura' and ‘fulgora' his successors have omitted
in consecutive lines 011 p. 170, to correct. I place first the
and so on. Ι have used Holder’s error of Smiffi, with the names
second edition. How little most of those editors who have
of these editors, except Hussey‚ followed him3 then the true
have done for the correction of reading with the names of its
Smith's text will be seen from adherentS.
