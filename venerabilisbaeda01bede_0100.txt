labour. Ι have, however, been able to arrive at some
results which are probable and not uninteresting. They
may at any rate serve as starting-points for any who
wish to pursue t-he subject further. Readings from
these later MSS. which from this, or any other point of
view, seemed to be of interest, are occasionally given in
the critical notes. More will be found in the additional

critical notes at the end of vol. i. The Anglo-Saxon
version is also occasionally cited.

ξ 22. The MSS. of the Hist. Eccl. are extremely
numerous. Hardy, in his Catalogue, i. 433—441, enu-
merates 133 ¹, the highest figure reached by any work in
the first volume of that Catalogue, except Geoffrey of
Monmouth’s De Gestis Regum Britanniae, of which 172
MSS. are enumerated (ib. 341—348). The juxtaposition
is interesting. For if Bede be the father of English
History, Geoffrey is no less surely the father of mediaeval

romance.
The four oldest MSS. on which the text of the present

edition is based are the Moore MS. (M), Cambridge Univer-
sity Library, Kk. v. 16 3 Cotton, Tiber. A. xiv ( ) ; Cotton,
Tiber. C. ii (C) 3 Namur, Bibliotheque de la Ville (N).

ξ 23. Namur, u. s. (N). No. 1 1 in the printed Cata-

1 From these must be de-
ducted Laud 78 (p. 437) which
is not the Eccl. Hist. at all, and
the Arras MS. (p. 4381, which is
not Bede’s Hist. Eccl. but Ru-
finus’ Latin translation and
continuation of Eusebius. Nor
when Ι was at Arras in 1892
could Ι hear anything of the
ninth-century MS. mentioned
by Hardy, u. S. p. 435. Possibly
he means the Codex Bertinianus
cited by Bouquet, viii. 79. On
the other hand there should be
added Brit. Mus. Add. 18‚150
