I have not met with this. Gehle (p. 60> gives refer-
ences to authors who have cited 11.

CAPITULA LECTIONUM on various books of 1116 Old Testa-
ment.

According to Gehle (pp. 62, 63) those on Genesis and
Kings in the printed editions of Cologne and Basle may
be genuine. The rest he pronounces spurious. I have
not examined them myself. Bede seems to have pro·
jected a regular commentary on the Pentateuch. opp. ix.

34 ; x· 330-

CAPITULA LECTIONUM IN TOTUM Novum TESTAMENTUM
EXCEPTO EVANGEL101.

I have not met with this.

IN APOSTOLUM QUAECUMQUE IN oposoums SANCTI Auens-
TINI EXPOSITA INVENI.

The work printed With this title and found in many
MSS. is not by Bede, but by Florus Lugdunensis The
genuine work does, however, exist in MS. ; one MS. 15 at
Troyes, according to Giles, Opp. xii. pp. x—xii; another
is at Monte Casino, No. 178 (see Bibliotheca Oasinensis,
vol. iv, under that number, where also an edition of it is
promised, Which, as far asI know, has not yet appeared 2).

¹ These two works are prob-
ably referred to by Lupus, Abbot
of Ferrara, in a letter 10 Altsig,
Abbot of York‚ under the title
‘Bedae . . . Quaestiones in utrum-
que Testamentum? H. & S. iii.

635. St. Boniface asks Arch-
bishop Egbert to send him ‘Beda
super lectionarium anniuersa-
rium.' lb. 389; Mon. Mog. p.
250.

² It is interesting to find that

in the twelfth century Robert
de Monte, or de Torigny, Abbot
of ‘St. Michael in the peril of
the Sea ’ (Mont St. Michel), dis-

cussed the authorship of two
collections, which may probably
be identified with the two
named above. Cf. Prologus

breuiationem Expositionis
