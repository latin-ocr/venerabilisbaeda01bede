522] Bede's Lefe and Worlcs. xxiii

one desire is to benefit others, he has little care to claim
originality for himself. He takes frecly from preceding
writers whatever he thinks usesul for his purpose ¹, though
he has 3 11111011 greater sense of litei-ary property 111311 13 31
311 00111111011 among mediaeval writers, ·’ being anxious lest
he should be said to steal the sayings of the elders. and
give them out as his own ².’ With this object he begs the
copyists of his theological works to preserve the indica—
tions which he has placed in the margins of the sources
from which he borrowed3 a request which they 11319
totally ignored 3. Ι11 1119 same way in his historica}
works he freely uses, and 11919 111111 1933 acknowledge-

252, 315, 357. 0119 reason which
Bede gives for writing his com·
111911131193 13 1119 great expense
of the original works on which
they were based: ‘ tam copiosa,
ut uix, nisi 3 locupletioribus tot
uolumina acquiri . . . ualeant?
Opp. 111. 1. 2. Bede knew what it
was to suffer from want of books 3
speaking of Paterius’ 0319113 of
passages from Gregory’s works
explanatory of Holy Scripture,
he says: ‘quod opus si haberem
ad manus, facilius multo . . .
studium meae uoluntatis imple-
rem ; uerum . . . necdum illud
merui uidere,’ ix. 388. Hence he
is anxious to popularise the
knowledge which he has ac-
quired: ‘ut ad plurimos res ipsa
perueniat: vi. 140. Another
reason is the distance of himself
and his readers from the pheno-
mena described, ix. 2003 3 passage
cited by S. D. i. 228, and given in
the notes to H. Ε. 1. 15 ctdfln. Cf.
on all this XVernenpp. 35-37, 195.

¹ Cf. H. E. V. 24, p. 357, sup.
p. x.

² ⁴ Sollicitus per omnia ne
maiorum dicta furari, et haec

quasi mea propria componere
dicar.' Opp. x. 269.

3 ‘Multumque obsecro . . . ut
si qui forte nostra . . . opuscula
transscriptione digna duxerint,
memorata quoque nominum sig-
na, ut in nostro exemplari re·
perimit, adfigere meminerint‚'
ib. 3 to 1119 331119 effect, ib. 2, 3.
Cf. &Vei-ner, p. 195 : ‘ Selbst in
den altesten Handschriften
fehlen die Namenszeichen der
beniitzten Erklarer) A really
critical edition of Bede which
should show exactly how much
he borrowed, ‘and how much is
original is 3 great desideratum ;
‘necdum illud merui uidere?
Failing such an edition we are
always in danger of citing some-
thing as Bede’s which he merely
borrowed from a predecessor;
and the extracts given in these
notes must all be taken subject
10 that possibility. Stin, 91911 30,
they may be treated as charac-
teristic of Bede’s mind, 33 119
would not have embodied any-
thing which did not coincide
with his own thought and feel-
ing.
