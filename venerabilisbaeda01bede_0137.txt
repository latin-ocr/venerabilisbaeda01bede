de Greco in Latinum transtulit uel composuit ¹‚’ ff. 245 a-
248 b, a pedigree of the Counts of Flanders from IIildric
(Liderik) to Baldwin VII; a list of kings of the Franks.
from Clovis to Louis VI, ff. 248 b—249 a; three lections
from Bede on St. Oswald‚ f. 249b3 some Anglo·Saxon
Glosses, f. 2 50 a; the beginning of a homily for St. John
Baptist's Day, f. 2 50 b, and f. 251 a an interesting list of
books‘2; a catalogue probably of part of the library of the
monastery to which this MS. belonged. This was ap-
parently Peterborough. On f. 250 v0 appears the enti-y :
‘Anno Domini obiit frater . . . de burgo S. Petri'3 on
f. 249 v0 the name of ‘Humffridus Natures.' This is
probably the person who is known to have been a monk
of Peterborough in 1534, Rector of Paston 1548—1553,

and the recipient of a pension as of Peterborough in ι

1 5 5 3 ³.' On the top of the next page appears the name of
‘Henricus Storkes,' of whom Ι know nothing. At one
time the MS. must have been in the possession of some
zealous protestant, as the words ‘papa‚’ ‘apostolicus‚’ &c.,
are constantly erased. With the exception os the inser-
tion of iv. 14 it is a MS. of the C-type. And the insertion
betrays itself as such; for above iv. 14 is rubricated
‘alia' ; above iv. 15, ‘item ’ ; and above iv. 16 ‘capitulum
quintumdecimum‚’ though elsewhere this MS. has no
numbers to the chapters either in the text or in the
capitula.

¹ Α book with exactly the
same title occurs among the
Cambridge University MSS:
see the Catalogue‚ iv, 357*.

2 Printed in Neues Archiv der
Gesellschafc fiir altere deutsche
Gesch. ii. 433 (1876). Gottlieb,
u. i.‚ who places it among ‘un-
bestimmte Verzeichnisse.’

³ I owe the information given
above to Mr. Madan3 who also
refers to Gottlieb‘s Mittelalter·

liche Bibliotheken‚ No. 515. A
person of the same name, also
a monk of Peterborough, for-
merly owned MS. Gough Missal
No. 47; cf. Macray, Annzsss,
&c.‚ p. 447. But from the
handwriting of the entry,
he must have lived at an
earlier time. Probably the
family of Natures was resident
in the neighbourhood of the
monastery.
