contained in the little notice of himself and his works ss‘i'ssggst'f

which he has appended to the Ecclesiastical History¹:
‘Thus much conceiinng 1116 ecclesiastica] history of
Britain, and especially of the race of the English, I,
Baeda, a servant of Christ and priest of the monastery
of the blessed apostleS, st. Peter and st. Paul, which is at
Wearmouth and at Jarrow, have with the Lord’s help

111011 tradition is that Bede was
born at Mm1kt011, where a well
called Bede’s Well still exis-ts.
Cf. Murray's Durham and North—

this would agree fairly the 51316-
