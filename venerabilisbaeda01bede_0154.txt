cxxxvi Introduction. [PART 11.

Cotton. Tiber. D. iii. (C) 1; folio, 26·50 >< 19·00, in
double columns, of the twelfth century, ff. 249. It
was badly injured in the Cottonian fire. It also con-
tains lives of saints. The Hist. Abb. occupies ff. 144a—
149 b, and is preceded by the ‘Titulatio opusculorum
uenerabilis Bede presbyteri ab ipso edita,' i. e. the
list of Bede’s works taken from H. E. v. 242. I place
this MS. first, though it is not the oldest MS. of the
group, because it has certain marked peculiarities which
distinguish it from the other five members of the group,
and it is therefore convenient to treat it separately. Of
these peculiarities the most interesting is that it alone of
all the MSS. has preserved the division of the work into
two books at the beginning of ξ 14, which is certainly
original, as Bede himself mentions it in H.E. v. 24 3. In
ξ 18 there is an omission of nine words owing to homoio-
teleuton, and the fact that this lacuna is not found in any
of the other MSS. shows that none of them can be copied
from this. The other peculiarities are unimportant,
but they help to give this MS. a character of its own ⁴.

Omissions: p. 365, note 9: Ρ.

¹ Here again this symbol has
3. different signification from

what it has in the case of the
Hist. Eccl.

2 This begins ‘Beda famulus
Christi,' and ends ‘intercessionis
inueniam’3 which shows that
it was taken from a copy of the
H. E. which had the clause
‘Praeterea omnes,' &c., at the
end of the work.

3 p. 359: ‘historiam abbatum

. . in libellis duobus.'

bols D, P, H„ hare the same
signification as in the case of
