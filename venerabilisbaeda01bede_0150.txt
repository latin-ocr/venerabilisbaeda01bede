cxxxii Introduction. [PART 11.

Antwerp, 1565, 4to (second edition, St. Omer, 1622,
Svo). The object of Stapleton was to infiuence Elizabeth
against the Reformation, and to show the difference
between-⁴ the pretended reformers ' and the early Church
of Augustine and his companions.

Another translation was published by John Stevens in
1723 ¹, and a third by W. Hurst in 1814. Dr. Giles pub-
lished a revised version of Stevens’ translation separately
in 1840, and in his collected edition of Bede's works,
1843 2. A new and improved translation was given by
Mr. Gidley in 1870.

Of the Hist. Abb. a translation was published at
Sunderland in 1818 by the Rev. Peter Wilcock. Of the
Epistle to Egbert a translation was published at Oxford
in 1882. In 1853 Mr. Stevenson published in Church
Historians, vol. i, Part ii, translations of all the historica]
works of Bede, with the exception of the Metrical Life of
St. Cuthbert. The translation of the H. E. was based on
that of Stevens. The anonymous history of the Abbots
has never, to my knowledge, been translated.

B. THE MSS. or BEnE’s HIsToRY oF THE ABBoTs.

ξ 39. Of Bede’s History of the Abbots, eight MSS. are
known to me, all of which have been collated for this
edition. They are Harl. 3020 ; Digby 112 3 Cotton.
Tiber. D. iii3 Durham Cathedral Library, B. ii. 35 ;
Harl. 4124 ; Pembroke College, Cambridge, 124 3 Burney
310 ; Fairfax 6.

These MSS. fall into two clearly marked groups 3 the
first consisting of Harl. 3020 and Digby 112, the other
of the remaining six MSS.

¹ On this see Stevenson, u. s. bert and St. Felix, the De Locis
p. xxxiv. Sanctis, and the letters to Albi—

2 In this edition the Hist. nus and Egbcrt, were also trans-
Abb„ the prose lives of st. Cuth- lated.
