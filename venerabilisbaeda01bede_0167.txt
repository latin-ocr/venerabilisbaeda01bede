Claronologyy of Bede’s ῙΓψὶίὶνῃε. cxlix

720. IN GENESIM ¹.

In the course of the work Bede says : ‘Si onim hodi-
erna die, uerbi gratia, per calendas Apriles essct luna
septima decima.' Opp. vii. 117. In his chronological
works Bede takes his examples from the actual year in
which he is writing, vi. 130, 244, 249, 256. It is there-
fore probable that he is doing the same here 3 if so, this
criterion would fix it to the year 720, which would suit
very well. It must be before 7 31, 33 it is included in the
list of his workS, H. E. v. 24. It must be after 709 as it
is dedicated ‘antistiti Accae.’ Opp. vii. 1. (‘Abbati‚'
Opp. i. 169, is probably a mere misprint of Dr. Giles.
It has misled Dr. Bright⁷ p. 402.) The calculation of
the year from the criteria was made for me by my friend
Mr. Τ. A. Archer, the historian of the Crusades.

Before 725. DE RATIONE Β133ΕΧΤΙ.

Τ1113 was incorporated in the De Temporum Ratione
(see above, p. xxxvii), and must therefore be anterior to it.
There 13 nothing to show by how much it preceded it.
Bede, in incorporating it, merely says : ‘ In epistola . . .
quondam dixi? Opp. 171. 222.

Before 725. DE NATURA RERUM.

This is earlier than the De Temporum Ratione, as it is
cited in the preface to that work, where it is coupled
with the De Temporibus: ‘ duos quondam . . . libellos
composui.’ Opp. 171. 139. But because the two works
are coupled together it would hardly be safe to assume
that they were composed at the same time.

725. DE TEMPORUM RAT10NE2.

That this work was written in 725 is shown by the
mention of that year no less than three times in
the course 01;11;, cc. 49, 52, 583 Opp. 171. 244, 249, 256;

a separate work in MSS. and f.41.
