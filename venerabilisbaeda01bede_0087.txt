‘For about two weeks before Easter he was troubled
with weakness, and especially with difficulty of brcathing,
yet without much actual pain. And after that, he con-
tinued until Ascension Day' clicerful and rejoicing and
giving thanks to Almighty God every day and night, yea
every honr. He gave Iessons daily to us his disciples, and
the rest of the day he occupied himself, as far as his
strength allowed, in chanting the Psalms‚ and all the
night too he passed cheerfully in prayers and giving of
thanks to God, except only when a light slumber

¹ Here after the words ‘ad
diem Ascensionis dominicae,’
the ordinary text inserts ⁴ id est
vii. Kal. Iunii’ (May 26), while
the St. Gallen MS. reads ‘id
est vii. Id. Mai' (May 9). It
seems to me possible that both
these insertions may be later
glosses by scribes who embodied
in the text their own views as
to the date of Ascension Day
in the year of Bede's death.
Another possibility is that in
the st. Gallen reading the ‘ Id.’
may be due to the ‘id' of ‘id
est’ 3 then a later scribe, seeing
that ⁴vii. id. Iunii ' was an im-
possible date for Ascension Day,
altered ‘Iunii’ into ‘Mais
But putting these conjectures
aside‚ let us ask which date has
the better claim to be accepted.
It will be observed that it is said
here that Bede lived till Ascen-
sion Day3 while later in the
letter he is said to have died on
the fourth feria, i. e. Wednesday.
If Bede died after6 p.m. on
XVednesday, Ascension Day had
ecclesiastically begun. But the

question now arises: is the

inserted date, whether May 26
or May 9, the date of Ascension
Day, or of the civil day on which
Bede died, viz. the Wednesday
before Ascension Day'? It ap-
pears to me that the former is·
far more probable. It seems very
forced to explain the date as
referring to a day not yet men—
tioned. Now Ascension Day did
fall on May 26 in 7353 where-
as it fell on May 9 in 720, and
then not again till 799, both
impossible years. M. & L. take
the view that the inserted
date refers to the Wednesday,
and they urge that the years in
Which Ascension Eve fell on
May 26, viz. 751, 762, and 773.
are all impossible, and out of
the years in which it fell on
May 9, viz. 731, 742, and 750.
they decide for 742. Ι cannot
agree with them for the reasons
given above ; and 1 holdthatBede
died on a day which civilly was
Wednesday, May 2 5, 73 5 : though
ecclesiastically it was Ascension
Day, because he died after6p.m.:
cf. ins. p. clxii z ‘diem ultimum
usque acl uesperum duxit.’
