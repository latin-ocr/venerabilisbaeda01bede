H3, is that in the letter on the death of Bede H3 omits the
Anglo-Saxon verses, leaving a blank space of three lines
for thern, whereas Ar. gives them, though in such a form
as shows that the scribe did not understand them. If
then Ar. was copied froin H„ the scribe must have got
the verses from some other source. And this is not
impossible; but the other explanation is simpler and
more probable. Ar. is a very ornamental MS„ adorned
with coats of arms, &c.¹ But it is very carelessly written.

a good deal has been lost besides the commencement

tests 4 and 5 cannot be applied ; but there cannot be
the slightest doubt that it belongs here. The following
instances will show conclusively the close connexion of
these three MSS. with 01 and with one another. In

The first are the arms of De-
