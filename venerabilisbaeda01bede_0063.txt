513] Bedc’s Life (mul leJcs. xlix

ties, the incident taking place in a stone-strewn valley as
Bede is 011 a journey, and it is the stones which cry out,
‘ Amen, uenerabilis Pater.’ The ordinary account os tho
origin of the epithet may be given in Fuller's quaint
words: ‘He is generally surnamed venei-able, but why
authours differ therein—Some say, a dunce monk, being
to make his epitaph, was non-plussed to make that dactyle,
which is onely of the quorum in the hexameter, and there-
fore at night left the verse, gaping, “Hic suut in fossa
Bedae . . . ossa,’' till he had consulted With his pillow, to
fill up the hiatus. But returning in the morning, an
angel (we have often heard of their singing, sce now of
their poetry> had filled up the chasm with ‘⁶ uenera-
bilis ¹.’' '

Most of Bede’s theologica] works are dedicated to Acca,
bishop of Hexham2, for whom he evidently cherished
a warm affection3 3 and as Acca did not become bishop
till 709, these Works cannot be earlier than that year.
The latest of his purely theologica] works would seem to
be the Retractations on the Acts, as it is not mentioned

in the list of Bede’s works at the end of the Ecclesiastical
History written in 731 4.

¹ Both these tales are found
in a short life printed by Giles,
Opp.I. clxi. f. Of the former an
Icelandic version may be seen
printed at the end of Hakonar
Saga, R. S. pp. 433, 434. Yet a
fourth legend in Gehle, pp. 36, 37.

² *In Genesim, *In Samuelem,
De Templo, *In Ezram et
Neemiam, *In Marcum, *In
Lucam, *In Acta, *De Mansioni-
bus Filiorum Israel, *De Eo quod
ait Isaias, &c. Those marked
with an asterisk were written
at Acca's request, or 111 answer
to questions addressed by him.
So also was the hymn on the

Day of Judgement, infr. App.
I. pp. cliii, cliv. In the Mer·
ton MS. No. 175, the dedica-
tory epistle prefixed to the De
Templo is addressed to Not-
helm, not, as in Giles, to Acca.
So also in the Phillipps MS.
No. 9428, for a sight of which
I am indebted to the courtesy
of Messrs. Maggs brothers, into
whose possession it ca1ne; and
in MS. Reg. 5. D. x.

³ See notes to H. E. v, 20.

¹ This is not absolutely con-
clusive. The De Locis Sanctis
is omitted from that list, though
it is cited H. E. v. 17 ad fin.
