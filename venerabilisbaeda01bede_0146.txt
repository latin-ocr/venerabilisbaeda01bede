bernensionem ’ [-bor- An] for ‘doruuentionemf But the
two most decisive cases are the following. In iii. 25,
p. 186, 11. 6-7, in the phrase ‘a XIIIIa luna primi mensis
[ad uesperam usque ad XXIam lunam eiusdem mensis] ad
uesperam‚⁷ 01 has by homoioteleuton omitted the words
in brackets. 01² has inserted on the margin ‘usque
ad . . . mensis.' Thus one ‘ ad uesperam ³ is lost. And
this defective reading is the reading of the text of 07,
In v. 7, p. 294, 1. 2, 01 reads ⁴an. et cons. 1111.'
0,2 has on the margin expanded cons. (rightly) into ‘con-
sulatus‚' adding ‘sui’; but 0,, H37 Ar. have all the im-
possible expansions of the contractions ‘ante et constantio
quarto.' 1 have said above that the table of contents of
07 shows that the volume originally contained more than
the H. E. This is the table: ‘Historia Anglorum . . .
Bede . . . 3
locis sepulture nonnullorum sanctorum Anglie’; τ’. e.
the additional matter in 07 was largely identical with
that in H3 and Ar. I have little doubt therefore that
074, H3‚ and Ar. were all copied from a common original⁷
which was itself derived mediately or immediately
from 01¹.

2 The Anglo-Saxon version is
cited at the beginning of AElfric's
Homily on Gregory: ‘istoria
Anglorum ba Pe AElfred cyning
of Leden on Englisc awend,' ‘The
Historia Anglorum which King
Alfred turned from Latin into
English,’ ed. Elstob, p. 4. More
remarkable is that it is cited,
and a quotation made from it,
by Rudborne, Ang. Sac. i. 183.
He seems to think that Bede
himself wrote the Saxon version :
‘liber quem composuit in lingua.
Saxonica de Gestis Anglorum‚ . . .
