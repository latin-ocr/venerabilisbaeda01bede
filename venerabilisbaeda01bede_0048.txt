and 716, Bede expresses his fear lest the sins of the
nation should bring upon them yet sorer punishment ¹.
And it was perhaps some of these troubles which had for
a while prevented him from attempting the St. Luke ².

In the very year in which Bede finished his Ecclesias-
tical History‚ Ceolwulf, King of Northumbria⁷ to whom
that history was dedicated, and of whom Bede speaks in
the highest terms3⁷ was seized‚ forcibly tonsured, and
thrust into a monastery. Later in the year he was
restored3 but in -7 37 he voluntarily became a monk in
Lindisfarne 4. Bede alludes to these troubles towards the
end of his history 5. While in the letter to Egbert,
written about four years later, he speaks of the danger
from the barbarians⁶⁷ meaning probably the Picts, who7
ever since their defeat of ngrid in 685, had been
threatening Northumbria ⁷.

This same letter to Egbert is one long lament over the
ecclesiastica] evils of the time 3 the greed and evil lives of
some of the bishops‚ and their neglect of their duties8 3 the
rise of false monasteries which took that name only to
avoid the secular services for which lay lands were liable ⁹ 3
