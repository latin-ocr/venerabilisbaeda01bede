and interesting way. His object apparently was to pro· Conssation
vide two homiletic discourses, one for Benedict Biscop's' ἨΜ n'xt’
day, the other for Ceolfrid’s. For the first he followed
Bede's Hist. Abb. as far as the end of ξ 14, appending to
it a homiletic doxology2. For the second he took as his
basis the anonymous Hist. Abb., which not only contains
particulars of Ceolfrid’s earlier life which are not in Bede,
but also by its homiletic exordium lent itself excellently
to the purpose of the scribe. To this also he appends
a doxology³. He was not however content with this,
but interpolated the anonymous text from time to time
with passages taken from Bede’s Hist. Abb. He has not
always done his work very skilfully. In one instance he
introduces from Bede a passage practically identical
with one which had already occurred in the Hist.
Anon., and tries to gloss the matter over by inserting
the words ‘ut supra iam diximus ⁴.' Hence even in this
second part there are considerable passages which are
available for the criticism of Bede’s Hist. Abb. In the
critical notes Ι have distinguished the readings of these
passages by the symbol δ. It is in one of them that the
lacuna alluded to above occurs, proving that they also are
taken from HI. The earlier lacuna has also influenced
the text ; for it has obliged the scribe to revert suddenly
and awkwardly from the text of Bede to that of the Hist.
Anon. Other points of agreement between Hl and δ may
be seen in the critical notes. The type of text exhibited

by these two MSS. may be called the H-text. It is that
which I have adopted.

§40 The text of the other six MSS. is of a different The second
type; and a glance at the critical notes will show that gmup'
where these MSS. differ from the H-text, they, in the
large majority of cases, agree exactly among themselves.
