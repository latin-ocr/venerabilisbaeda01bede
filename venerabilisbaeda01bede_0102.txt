lxxxviii Introduction. [PART 11.

been executed, I had not at that time collated the other
MSS„ and had not realised fully the worthlessness (101
textual purposes) of this MS. We need not go beyond
the preface and the first chapter 01 1110 first book to see
how ignorant the scribes were of Latin; thus: ‘prae-
scriptum ' 101 ‘presbyterum‚' p. 6, l. 153 ‘scriptare
padsumsi’ for ‘scripta repperi, adsumsi,’ p. 7, l. 2 from
bott0m3 ‘unum ferunt' for ‘ auium ferax‚’ p. 10, l. 23
⁴ pallerare ⁹ for ‘pallesce1·e‚’ ib. 14, &c. Their ignorance
01 history and geography is shown by the way in which
they have bungled over the word ‘Scotti'3 thus: ‘ad-
rantos’ 101 ‘ad ScottOS,’ heading 01 1. 133 ‘rectorum ’
and ‘sanctorum' 101 ‘Scottorum‚’ p. 71, ll. 8, 22, &c
The commonest contractioris are mistaken3 ‘quam,’
‘quia' and ‘quod' are constantly confused3 so ‘pen’
‘prae,’ ‘pro,' ‘post' and ‘propter'3 ⁴c0n‚' ‘cum,' and
‘contra' 3 ‘tamen' and ‘tantum'3 ‘sed ' and ‘sicut '3
‘a’ and ‘aut’3 ‘hoc’ and ‘autem'3 ‘aut’ and ‘ante'3
(01Ἶ) ⁹ (episcopo) and ‘ff ' (ipso) p. 328, 1. 16. Omissions
are frequent 3 the most important being in v. 12, and at
the 01111 01 v. 22. Sometimes the scribes could not read
their copy, and spaces were left which were only filled
up later, or not at all. The MS. has been corrected
throughout by later hands. But the corrections are 011011
as bad as, sometimes worse than, the original text¹.
Hence. except in the case 01 proper names2 this MS. is
only sparingly cited. Nor need it be taken into account

in discussing the mutual relationships of the various .-

MSS.⁷ 101 so far as 1 have discovered, no other MS.
shows any special affinity 10 this one 3. In the general
type 01 text Which it exhibits it agrees with M and Β

⁷ against C.

p. 24 ad ped.. the latter being ² See above, p. lxxxiv.
right3 uirum for uiro, p. 260, ³ R2 is a partial exception;
l. 25, where uiro is right; de see below, p. cii.
