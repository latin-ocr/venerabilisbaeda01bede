a beautiful account of the gracious and saintly tact with
which men like Cuthbert, Eostelwvine, and Ceolfrid
managed their sometimes troublesome floeks2. Inter-
views with the abbot or prior provoked, no doubt, the
same sort of speculation and comment as interviews
with the president 01· (10311 of a college do now. Only
the penalties inflicted would be different. Genera]
admonitions were given by the prior or abbot in an
assembly of all the 1110111133, and subjects of common

interest were debated there 4.

for the abbreviations for ‘ prae’
and ‘ pro’ are very easily con-
fused, became a well-established
form, as is shown by the fact
that it has given us our word
‘ provost,’ AS. profost, prasost3

while the French prevot comes
from ‘ praepositus.’ This was
the office held by Cuthbert at
Lindisfarne. Vit. Cudb. c. 163
Opp. Min. p. 79. (Whether the
‘prioratus' which Ceolfrid at
XVearmouth was so nearly
throwing up in disgust was the
office of ‘ prior' in the technical
sense of the word, may, I think,
be doubted. Hist. Anon. ξ 8,
p. 390. H. & S. think that the
signature ‘ Torhthelm prior ⁵ to
the Council of Clovesho in 825
is ‘ the first occurrence of this
title in a contemporary English
document,’ iii. 600-601. It oc-
curs in a non-monastic sense in
Egbert's Dialogue, ib. 406.) S. D.
i. 22, ‘speaks of Cuthbert as ‘ se-
cundus ab abbate praepositi
iure: ib. 129 : ‘ successit in prae-
positi, id est, prioris officium ’ 3
cf. ib. 119 (of William of st.
Carilef), ‘primo . . . prior
claustri, deinde secundus ab

abbate, maior scilicet prior con-
stituitur.’ The very titles of this
officer in the Irish monasteries,
‘secnab,' ⁶ tanaise abbaid ' (or
‘ tanaise ' alone), imply that 110
was ‘ secundus ab abbate.’ (The
RM. in 869 and 873 give ‘ prioir’
for the ‘ secnab ³ and ‘ tanaise '
of the Ann. Ult. In 887 they
use ί13113130 abbaidJ Dr. Reeves
(Ad. p. 364) translates this last
phrase ‘ coadjutor — successor.9
Cf. S. C. S. ii. 63.)
