cxxx Introduction. [PART ΙΙ.

4 and 5 cannot be applied: in other respects it seems
to be taken from a MS. of the M-type. About the same
time Eggesteyn printed an edition of the Latin version of
Eusebius. Both these were reprinted at Strasburg in
a single volume in 1500. The Bede reproduces all the
features of the editio princeps; and this is the case also
with the reprint of the same two works by Heinrich
Gran, Hagenau, 1506. In 1550 a separate edition of
Bede's HE. was published at Antwerp by John Grauius¹.
This not only contains the whole of v. 24, but the
continuation of Bede’s Chronology is given continuously
with it, preceding the list of Bede’s works. The preface
ends with ‘studuimusz ' The work ends: ‘Te deprecor

. . faciem tuam, qui uiuis et legnas etc. Amenss.
Then comes Bede's epitaph, and the date of his death3
and then ‘Beda ad lectorem. Omnes . . . inueniam.
Vale 4.' But Ι am inclined to think that this arrange-
ment is due to the editor. In most of the test points
this edition follows the M-text. These features are
reproduced in the collected Basle edition of Bede's works,
1563, except that the clause ‘Beda ad lectorem . . . Vale '
is printed <in a different type) at the end of the preface.
All these editions are 111 folio. Octavo editions of the
HE. appeared at Louvain in 1566, and in 1566-7.
In 1583 it was embodied 111 1116 Η151. Christ. ueterum

Commelin’s Rerum Britannicarum Scriptores, Heidel-
berg. This last seems to have been taken from a good
MS. of the M-type5. The continuation is printed con-
tinuously, but distinguished by different type. In 1601
there was an Svo edition of the H. E. at Cologne, and in
1612 appeared the Cologne reprint of the Basle edition of
