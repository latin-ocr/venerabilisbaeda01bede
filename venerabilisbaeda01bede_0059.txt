Ecclesiastical History was written, as we saw, in 731.
Besides this there are the Lives of the Abbots of lVear-

the divine judgement on Cold-
ingham from Aedgils, a former
priest of that monastery, iv. 25,
p. 266. The miracles of iv. 32
and v. 1 came from the persons
immediately concerned, pp. 280,
281. For the miracles of Bishop
-John of Hexhain his deacon
Berthun was the chief authority,
V· 2, 3⁹ 4, 57 pp· 283, 285, 286,
289. One came direct from the
person healed, v. 6, p. 289. The
vision of Drythelm was told to
Bede by Haemgils, a priest who
heard it from Drythelm himself,
v. 12, p. 309. Two other facts
Bede owed to Bishop Pecthelm,
v. 13, 18, pp. 313, 320. At the
end of the H. E. Bede sums up
his authorities under the three
heads of previous writings, the
tradition of the elders, and
personal knowledge, v. 24, pp.
356, 357. For the last, 01. 1. 1,
p. 13: ‘ uidimus.' The ‘traditio
maiorum' is cited also, ii. 1,
p. 79, cf. ib. p. 81. VVhere Bede
gives a story on merely hearsay
evidence he is careful to state
the fact: thus ‘sertui-,⁹ i. 13

hibentur,’· iv. 14, p. 2323 ‘sunt
qui dieant‚' iv. 19, p. 244. In
the Hist. Abb. Bede cites no
authorities. He was here writ-
ing mainly of matters which
would be within his own per-
sonal knowledge. Neither does

he cite 111(Δ anonymous¹ Hist.
Abb. which hc certainly mul.
In the Prose life 01 Cutlihert
Bede does not cite the Anony-
mous life. though hc alludes to
it, H. E. pref. p. 7. On the other
hand he frequently cites his
other authorities: cc. 3 ad fin„

36 odfin„ 37. Opp. Min. pp. 55,

59, 60, 94, 99, 107, 114, 116,117.
And in the Preface to the same

work he gives his reasons for
thus carefully citing his authori-
ties, ib. pp. 45, 46 (see this
passage in the notes to H. E.
Pref.). When therefore Lappen-
berg talks of Bede’s ‘glaring
lack of historic-al criticism,'
‘ greller Mangel an historischer
Kritik' (i. 74, E. T. i. 76N, he is
applying to Bede a totally in-
applicable standard. Professor
Sanday has excellently said with
reference to the book of the
Acts that it is hardly reason-
able ‘to require the gifts of

saith must be plain to everyone
who reads his narrative. W. Μ.
calls him ‘Beda adulari nescius,'
i. 57. The only point which
creates a doubt is his suppression
of certain incidents in the life
of Wilfrid, see notes to H. Ε. v,
19. VVhether 110 did this out of
regard to the memory of Wilfrid
or of the kings who opposed
him, Ι cannot say. Mommsen
says of him: ‘Einen ueram his-
toricus nennt er sich selbst (H. Ε.
111. 17), und er hat ein Recht
