Tim HOMILIES.

The Homilies would, of course, be written from time
to time as they were required, and therefore naturally
cannot be exactly dated. Tho criticism of the genuine-
ness of the various homilies attributed to Bede would be
a very difficult task. Of those printed by Giles Ι believe
all to be genuine except the following: Nos. 10, 12—15,
19, 58 are spurious; No. 7, as I have shown, is a
genuine homily of Bede’s (No. 56), fitted with a new
exordium3 Nos. 11 and 15 I have also shown to be
extract-s from Bede’s Commentaries on Mark and Luke
respectively (v. 3. pp. xlvii, xlviii).

Hmm.

Of the fourteen Hymns printed by Giles, Opp. i. 54-
103, Nos. 1—3 are in hexameters, and deal with sub-
jects connected with the Calendar. They are probably
genuine. There are many things in them besides their
subject which are characteristic of Bede—the doctrine of
the six ages, pp. 60, 66, 683 the mystica] interpretation
of numbers, pp.61, 62, cf. 64 3 t-he sear to keep back know-
ledge bestowed by God, p. 56 ; the exhortation to prelates
to teach by example and not only by precept, and to be
careful whom they ordain, pp. 64, 65. Nos. 4—13 are in
iambic tetrameters. No. 4, on the correspondence of the
six ages of the world With the six days of Creation, is very
characteristic of Bede (see above, pp. xli, xlii), and its
genuineness is expressly testified to by Alcuin ε ⁴ Hymnus

pulcherrimus de sex dierum opere et de sex aetatibus
mundi.' Mon. Alc. pp. 748, 749. The others are ordinary

festival hymns, some of considerable merit. They may

well be genuine, though there is nothing specially charac-

teristic of Bede in them. No. 14 is in hexameters, and

deals with a favourite subject of Bede's, viz. the Day of

J udgement, though it is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.

Instead of the conclusion ‘Rex Deus,' &c., as given by
