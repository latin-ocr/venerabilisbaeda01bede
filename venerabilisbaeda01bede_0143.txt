both read ‘huic ⁷ for ‘hic,’ O¹7 has ‘uel grandine ' written
above ὁ8111111111οβ while O¹1 reversos them, putting ‘ gran—
dine' in the text and ‘gramine ³ above. These variants
Ι have noticed in no other MSS. In v. 1, p. 282, 1. 3,
017 has over the word ‘undiqueuersum’ the gloss ‘i. ex
omni parte.' Oll writes in the text, ‘undique ex omni parte
uersum.' This might look like actual copying; but at
p. 182, 1. 19, O¹1 has the reading ‘de obseruantia one
paschae‚’evidently copied from a MS. which had ‘obser-
uantia ’ in the text With ‘one7’ r2'. e. ‘ obse1²uatione,' written
as an alternative above. But this MS. is not Off, Which
has the ordinary reading ‘ de obseruatione paschae 1.'

.table of contents a good deal has been lost besides the
conclusion of the H. E. The clause ‘Praeterea omnes'
does not occur in the preface, We may therefore assume
that it was placed at the end3 unless indeed, as with
Bu„ it occurred in neither place. But this is unlikely.
After the word ‘studuimus7' With Which the preface in
the C-text ends, this MS. has the unintelligible addition,
peculiar to itself: ‘tempore pro Domino sanctum est
fuderunt.' The MS. came to the College ‘ex legato . . .
Roberti Ketrinham‚ quondam Rectoris ecclesie Sancti
Gregorii Lundon. Oretis igitur pro eodem, et bene-
factoribus eiusdem‚ omnium ac fidelium animabus a
purgatorio liberandis,’ There are no other marks of
ownership.
