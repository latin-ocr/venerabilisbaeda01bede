indeed the best known of all his works ; that by which
almost alone he keeps a place in the thoughts of any besides
professed students of history or theology. There aro scenos
in it which live in the hearts of every one of us: the
picture of the Anglian slave boys in the Roman Forum,
whose fair angelic faces first stirred in the heart of Gregory
the desire to save from the wrath of God the souls that
dwelt within such heavenly forms¹ ; the story of the
Northumbrian thane who gave his voice for the intro-
duction of Christianity, in the hope that it would throw
some light on the dark problems of existence, the whence
and the whither of the human soul, which seemed to him
like a sparrow which flits in winter through a lighted
hall, passing from darkness into darkness23 the descrip-

Ι. xliv. 204, 205, E. T. Ι. xxxiv.
209, 210. W. M. himself claims
not unjustly to be the first con-
tinuer of Bede's work: ‘quod
continuam Anglorum historiam
ordinauerim post Bedam uel
solus, uel primus? ii. 518, 567 ;
cf. H. H. pp. xxiv, 117. (No
one however will agree with one
of the scribes of H. H.: ‘ea
quae Beda in sua Historia pro-
lixe et confusius posuit, iste
abbreuiando et ordinando elu-
cidauit.’ Hardy, Cat. ii. 276.)
Fl. Wig. i. 535 Elmham, p. 279:
‘Bedam . . . legat et relegat
studens lector, ponentium in
coelum os suum scriptorum . . .
pompatica 'dictamina parui-
pendens3' cf. ib. 309, 313. Ead-
mer: ‘Beda nobilissimus nostrae
gentis historiae scriptor.’ H. Y.
i. 162. ‘Beda historiam . . .
usque in hunc annum [731]
mirabili opere perduxit.’ Pertz,
ii. 281. sigeb. Gembl. gives up
noticing English affairs after
Bede’s death: ‘quia historias
quas sequar non habeo.’ Pertz,

vi. 331. So the Ch‘ronicle of
Melrose says: ‘Postquam ueri-
dicus hystoriographus et doctor
eximius, decus et gloria nostrae
gentis, Beda uenerabilis, scribere
cessauit, non inuenti sunt aliqui
. . certi uel continui relatores,
qui in . . . euentibus recitandis
. . . operam impenderent,' p. 1.
For interesting appeals to the
historical authority of Bede, see
S. D. i. 9, 108, 120, 1703 G. P.
p. 44 ; sax. Chron. F. 995. Fora
catena of testimonies to Bede, see
M. & L. pp. 176 ff. On the way in
which later historical writing
in England grows out of Bede,
see some interesting remarks
in Stubbs’ Hoveden, I. ix, X.

¹ H. E. ii. 1, pp. 79, 80. The
admiration of the swart Italians
for fair complexions comes out
in Dante also3 cf. Purg. iii. 107
(of Manfred) :—

‘Biondo era e bello, e di
gentile aspettoff

So ib. viii. 34, the Angels have
‘testa bionda.’
