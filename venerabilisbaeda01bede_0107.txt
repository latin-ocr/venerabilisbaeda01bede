slightly damaged by the great Cottonian firc ¹. The
gatherings are of eight leaves. The writing is ‘pointed
Saxon minuscules,' but less pointed than that of B. The
initials of each chapter are issuminalbed, and there are
elaborate ornainentations at the beginning of each book.
Contractions are fairly frequent. On the blank spaces, on
folios 5r¹‘‚ 34v0‚ 60 VO, a later hand 1135 written some
Anglo-Saxon glosses on words occurring in the text of
Bede. These glosses have been printed by Mr. Sweet
(Oldest English Texts, pp. 179-182), who thinks that they
are Kentish. Besides these written glosses there occur
sporadically in parts of the MS. interlinear Anglo-Saxon
glosses scratched with a stylus ². Musica] notes occur on
folios 181‘0, 26 r07 29 r0‚ 59 r0, 132 VO, in 3 hand of the
tenth or eleventh century. The MS. has been corrected
throughout by later hands. At the beginning and at the
end 3 folio of 3 fourteenth-century psalter 1135 been
inserted. C is certainly a Durham book (possibly brought
originally from Lindisfarne). This is proved by two
little facts of great significance. At the beginning of
the prefixce, C has the impossible reading ‘meditaturum “
for ‘meditandum,' a reading which occurs in no other
MS. which I have examined except Os> where it is given
