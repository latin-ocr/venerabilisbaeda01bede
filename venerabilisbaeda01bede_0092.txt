Introduction.

[PAR'r Ι.

Know

moreover that many things could be narrated and written
concerning him, but my unlearned tongue makes my

words the briefer.

But I purpose with the help of Grod

to write at leisure more fully about him the things Which
my eyes have seen, and my ears have heard 2⁸>
And so he passed away 3, the very model of the saintly

uita, qui angelicam in terris
conuersationem sequuntur3 ui-
delicet sobrie, et iuste, et pie, et
caste uiuendo, ac diuinis laudi-
bus semper, quantum mortali
possibile est, uacando‚’ Opp.
vii. 202: ‘nonest laboriosa sed
amabilis et optanda seruitus, in
Dei laudibus perpetuo adsis-teres
v. 271.

2 If this last sentence is
genuine, the intention was
either not carried out, or the
letter has perished.

3 ‘Senex annis et sapientia,
et plenus dierum non in uano
consumptorum.’ H. H. p. 115.
‘De eo loquamur, reminiscentes
memoriam sanctitatis eius, et
gratias ei referentes pro suis
laboribus.' S. D. ii. 23. W. M.
i. 67, gives his epitaph which
he calls ‘pudendum prorsus et
tanti uiri mausoleo indignum ' 3
and asks indignantly whether
Bede's monastery could not pro·
duce anything better than this:

‘Presbyter hic Beda requi-
escit carne sepultus,
Dona, Christe, animam in
caelis gaudere per aeuum.
Daque illi sophiae debriari
fonte, cui iam
Suspirauit ouans intento
semper amore.'
As to the fate of Bede’s relies,
see S. D. i. 42, 88, 89, 168, 252,

253 (cf. ib. 221, where Bede is
spoken as ‘breoma bocera‚'
‘ famous bookman'); R. W. i.
2233 Stevenson, Church His-
torians‚ I. ii. pp. iii, xx, xxi. They
were translated to Durham in
the eleventh century, and placed
with those of St. Cuthbert, whom
he had so fervently admired.
Alberic of Trois Fontaines in his
chronicle at the year 1115 cites
the following from Helinandus ε
‘uenerunt ad abbatiam . . .
que dicitussViltonia, ubi ostensa
est eis sepultura uenerabilis
Bede.’ He then continues in
his own person: ‘hic oritur
questio . . . quid sit uerius de
sepultura . . . Bede, uel si
utrumque stare potest, et quod
hic dicitur, et quod in legenda
translationis beati Cuthberti . . .
scribitur. Sed dicunt quidam
quod fuerunt duo Bede, primus,
qui fecit homelias, et iste de
wiltonia? Pertz, xxiii. 820.
The last sentence is interesting
as showing that Alberic knew
Bede chiefly by his homilies,
v. S. pp. xlvii, xlviii. For other
persons of the name of Bede cf.
Vit. Cudb. c. 37, Opp. Min. p.
120 (a priest of Lindisfarne);
Pertz, i.301 (a monk ‘monasterii
Anianensis a partibus Gotiae ³) ;
Fi. Wig. i. 253 (in the genealogy
of the Lindisfari. Curiously
enough this Bede has a son
