The

work S.

lxiv Introduction . [PART Ι.

ξ 16. Another point which may strike a modern reader
unfavourably in Bede’s historical works is the presence
of the miraculous clement in them. I have already said ¹
that in the life of St. Cuthbert Bede shows a tendency to
emphasise this clement beyond what his authorities
justify. It was natural to his age ², and especially
natural to his religious spirit to see direct interpositions
of the supernatural everywhere.

The subject of mediaeval miracles is one of considerable
difficulty. The large majority of them may be set aside
at once, as being quite deficient in anything like contem·
porary evidence. Many may be condemned summarily
on internal evidence, being silly, unspiritual, or even posi-
tively immoral. Others are open to suspicion as being
so evidently modelled on the miracles of the Bible‚ and
still more on those of the apocrypha] Scriptures3. Others
are merely classical myths, or widely diffused folk-tales
masquerading in an ecclesiastica] dress ⁵¹. Others need
not necessarily be miracles at all, but may be either mere
coincidences ⁵ brought about by perfectly natural means,
though a devout mind will gladly believe that they have

been divinely ordered ⁶ 3 or due to causes which are only

² ‘There are . . . ages when
belief is so utterly uncritical
that it does seem as if they
could not under any circum-
stances afford us satisfactory
evidence of miraculous occur-
rences.' Gom, Bampton Lec-
111165, p. 74.

The subjectis too intricate to be
gone into here, but would well
repay careful study. Of course
several of these grounds of sus·
picion may be present in the
same story.
