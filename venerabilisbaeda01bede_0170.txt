clii Introduction .· Appendioe Ι.

IN PROVERBIA ¹.

The De Muliere Forti often found in MSS.2 and
editions as a separate treatise is really only the last part
of this commentary.

IN CANTICA CANTICORUM ³.

The seventh book, which is a mere cento of passages
extraoted from St. Gregory, is sometimes found separ-
ately, e. 9. MS. Coll. Trin. Oxon, No. 52, f. 188 b ; so is the
first book, under the title ‘ Contra Iulianum diuine gratie
repugnatorem,' ay. MS. Phillips, 9428.

IN CANTICUM HABAooUo.

Dedicated to ‘dilectissima in Christo soror.' I cannot
agree with Werner, p. 180, in thinking that by this an
actual sister of Bede’s is meant. Some abbess or nun is
probably indicated.

THE MARTYROLOGY5.

The Martyrology as we have it has been so added
to, that it is impossible to tell what part, if any, is
really due to Bede. And there is much in it that one
would willingly believe not to be Bede's——too much
ecclesiastioal gloating over the physioal horrors of mar-
tyrdom, and legends of the purely silly kind. On the
so-called poetioal Martyrology, see below, p. clviii.
