tation of the numeral). I would not assert that all these
MSS. are directly copied from D. That is certainly the
case with Bu„ and Ι think also with H.» But some of
the later MSS. may be derived not immediately, but
mediately‚ from D. Still the points cited are sufficient
to show that they all belong to one family. Nor can it
be asserted that D itself was directly copied from the MS.
which was the ultimate progenitor of the two groups.
There may have been intermediate links.

The later MSS. sometimes exhibit either solely or in
combination the readings inserted by the correctors in
D ¹. Where this is not the case it would not be safe to
assume that the corrections in question must be posterior to
the transcript, as later scribes exercise their own discretion
as to the adoption or rejection of alternative readings.
