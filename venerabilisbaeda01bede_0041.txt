and a separate infirmary to which tho sick and dying

WVhen any member of the connnnnity

was known to be near his end, the brethren were assem-
bled in the church to pray for the departing soul2‚ and

the same was done after a death ³³.

A roll of departcd

⁴ The Liber Vitae of the
Church of Durham is still in
existence, MS. Cotton, Domi-
tian VII. It has been published
by the S. S.; and also by Sweet‚
Oldest English Texts, pp. 153-166.
From the Pref. Vit. Cudb. it ap-
pears that it was thc duty of
the ‘Mansionarius’ to enter the
names in the Album Congrega-

tionis. The community of Lin-
disfarne promised Bede that
his name should be entered in
this way, ib.; Opp. Min. pp. 47—
48. So Alcuin to Ethelbald‚
abbot of Wearmouth and-Jarrow:
‘antecessores tui . . . in albo
beatitudinis uestre meae parui-
tatis nomen conscribi iusserunt?
Mon. Alc. p. 839. Cf. Η.Ε. iv. 14,
notes. Bede uses these words
with beautiful effect of the
roll of the elect : ‘admonemur
quanta certitudine Dominus
summam electorum in libro
uitae conscribat, et uelut in albo
coeli consignet.’ Opp. viii. 3763
‘summus rex . . . congregatos a
mundi plagis omnibus electos
suos aeternae beatitudinis albo
conscribit,' x, 305. The earliest
known instance of a formal
agreement or confraternity be-
tween different monasterics for
mutual prayer of this kind is
perhaps somewhat later than
Bede's time. H. 81. S. iii. 342,
343; cf. ib. 432, 4343 Pertz, xiv.
