§ 40·] The Allcwzuseripta cxxxix

Moreover that these corrections wore made by Ware out
of his own head without reeourse to other MSS. is shown
by the fact that in two 1351311665 1115 corrections do not
agree with any MS.¹

Smith (1722) collat-ed Ware's text with D, P, and a MS.
which he calls ‘Merton,’ but which was probably, as
Hussey (praef. p. v> suggests, Fairfax, no MS. of the
Hist. Abb. existing in the Merton Library. Hence
Smith’s edition exhibits all the features of the D-text.

Stevenson (1841) was the first editor 10 base his text
on Hv and it is consequently a great improvement 03

Hussey (1 846)p1·actically reprinted Smith’s text, though
he used Stevenson’s edition, and also Digby 112 for the
notes. His text is a retrograde step as compared With
that of Stevenson.

Mobe1·1y(1869 and 1881) reprinted Smith’s text, col-
lating it with Fairfax, from which he Wrongly asserts

that Smith's text is taken.

Whether the difference between the H-text and the Possible
D-text implies 3 double 1666351011 by Bede himself, like ffgffission·
that which I believe to have existed in the 6356 of the
H. E„ is hard to say. On the whole Ι do not think the
differenees are greater than might be aeeounted for by
56111131 variations. If this is 6011661, 1116 relations of the

existing MSS. might be exhibited somewhat 35 follows ε
