history of Gregory of Tours with the continuation by
Fredegar is bound up with the Hist. Eccl. of Bede, but
the juxtaposition is purely fortuitous. The Bede occupies
sixty folios. The gatherings are of eight, six, and <in
one instance> four folios. The third gathering has been
lost, causing a lacuna which extends from ‘trahens sus-
piria,’ 11. 1, p. 80, to ‘crucem magnam auream,’ ii. 20,
p. 126. It is the work of several scribes, some of them
extremely bad; a fact which seems to show that it did
not issue from the scriptorium of a great monastery, but
from some little house where there were few if any
skilled scribes. The writing is continental—not Anglo-
Saxon—as Mene asserted. But it would seem to have
been copied from a MS. of Hiberno-Saxon character, as
may be inferred from the frequent confusions between
n and r2, and r and 33. Ι mention this MS. first, not
because of any special value or antiquity as compared
with the other three eighth-century MSS, but, on the
contrary, in order to clear it out of the way as soon as

which appeared in vol. xix of the Annales de la Societe
archeologique de Namur. But though Ι there spoke of
