whole of the N. T. As to the
Ο. Τ. Dr. Driver writes to me:
‘The idea of accident or chance
is not very common in the Ο. Τ.
but it occurs sometimes . . . It
would not be consonant with
Hebrew ideas of the world, to
dwell much on the action of
chance?
¹ The phenomena of mes-
merism and telepathy (as it is
called)¹ offer many points of
analogy with some of these
mediaeval miracles. In all cases
of nervous disease the mere
belief that a cure was probable
would be a powerful curative
agency. Of. A. Lang, Contempo-
rary Mag, Sept. 1893 ; Id.‚ Cock
Lane and Common Sense.
² Bede believed that Bishop
John of Hexham, by whom he
was ordained both deacon and
priest, had wrought several
miracles. H. E. v. 2-6. Bede's
view is that miracles are relative
to a cert-ain stage of develop-
ment: ‘haec necessaria in ex-
ordio ecclesiae fuerunt ; . . . quia
et nos cum arbusta plantamus,
. eis aquam fundimus3 . . .
at si semel radicem fixerint,
irrigatio cessabit! Opp. x, 261.
Moreover the cessation of mira-

cles is largely due to man's sin:
‘postquam enim 1101110 suo Con-
ditori subiectus esse noluit, per-
didit dominium eorum quae suo
Conditor iuri subiecerat.5 Opp
vii. 27. Some men by special
grace of holiness have recovered
part of this lost heritage : ‘qui
enim Auctori omnium creatura-
rum fideliter. . . famulatur, non
est mirandum si ei . . . omnis
creatura dei-seruiat. At nos . . .
creaturae dominium perd 1 dimus,
quia . . . Creatori omnium ipsi
seruire negligimus.' Vit. Cudb.
