and it is correctly so dated by Marianus ScotUS. Fl.
Wig. i. 50.
725 >< 731. IN EZRAM ET NEEMIAM1.

This must be after 725 as it refers to the De Temporum
Ratione, Opp. ix. 4, citing Opp. vi. 289, 290. It was
already projected when Bede was writing the In Genesim,
in the preface to which he says ε· ‘ Dum primo librum . . .
Ezrae . . . parumper perscrutatus fuero.’ Opp. vii. 2.
I do not understand this as meaning that the Ezra had
already been begun then, though that is the interpreta-
tion of Grehle, p. 103.

Probably before 729. DE TABERNACULO.

This was written before the De Templo, Opp. viii. 357,
which latter falls probably about 729. See the next
entry.

729 >< 731. DE TEMPL02.

In the letter to Albinus which accompanied the Hist.
Eccl. it is spoken of as having been written ‘nuper.' It
was therefore probably written not long before 731 3 and
with this agrees the allusion in the preface to temporal
troubles—‘praesentes rerum temporalium angores ³—by
which are probably meant the troubles which followed
the accession of Ceolwulf in 729. Of. H. E. v. 23 and
notes. And, curiously enough, in the H. E. itself, iii.
27 ad fin„ this very date, 729, is spoken of as ‘nuper.'
731. EPISTOLA AD ALBINUM.

This accompanied a copy of the Hist. Eccl., and there-

Samuelem. So too, along with
some things that are fanciful,

¹ This work, in which the
restoration of Jerusalem is

treated as a type of the
restoration of the sinful by
repentance‚ seems to me very
beautiful. It is brief, and con—
sequently there is not that ten-
dency to force minute details to
yield a symbolical meaning,
which was noticed in the In

there is much spiritual beauty
in the De Tabernaculo and
De Templo.

2 This was sent by Cuth-
bert, Abbot of Wearmouth and
Jarrow, to Lullus in answer to
his request, Mon. Mog. pp. 289,
290.
