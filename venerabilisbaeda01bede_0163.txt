ΤΟ INTRODUCTION, PART Ι.

ΟΝ THE CHRONOLOGY oF BEDE’s WRITINGS.

691 >< 703. DE ARTE Mmch and DE SCHEMATIBUS ΕΤ
TROPIS SACRAE SCRIPTURAE.

In the little address between these two works Bede

writes ε ‘Haec tibi dulcissime fili, et conlcm'ta Cuthberte

. . excerpere curaui,' showing that it was written while

Bede was a ‘leuita7' i. e. a deacon ¹.

Opp. vi. 78.

²? 691 >< 703. DE ORTHOGRAPHIA.
This is undated, but it probably belongs to the same

period as the preceding 2.

¹ On the use of the term ‘le-
uita ’ for demon, see Opp. i. 63 ;
viii. 383, 384. Bede identifies the
Nethinim with sub-deacons, ib.
375, 376, and the high priest with
an archbishop, ib. 451. We have
even ‘leuitissa,’ ⁴ deaconess.’
Ltft. App. Ff. II. iii. 468 3 cf. ib.
1. ii. 123, 329. In Giles' Ed. the
⁴ De Arte Metrica' is headed
‘ad Wa‘qbertum leuitam.’ What
the MS. authority for this is
Ι do not know. The only MSS.
that I have seen (S. J ohn's Con.
Oxon, No. 150, Digby 100) have
no heading3 in the address at
the end they read: ‘ conleuita
Cuthberte ' (amberte, st. J ohn's).
Cuthbert may be the author of
the letter on Bede’s death. If

SO‚ the suggestion that he was
only a ‘lector' at that time
(above, p. lxxii) must be given
up. There was a VVigbert who
became abbot of Lindisfarne,
Opp. Min. p. 43 ; and he is prob-
ably the abbot Wigbert who is
mentioned in the Liber Vitae
Eccl. Dun. Both MSS. prefix
the following distich :
‘Me lege si linguam cupias
cognoscere Bede,
Me quicunque capit, rustici-
tate caret.’
² Librum de o. alfabeti or-
dine distinctum.' This work
was used both by Alcuin and
W. M. The latter says of Bede ε
‘qui reliquis commodius in hoc
elaborauit, quia, quod illi confuso
