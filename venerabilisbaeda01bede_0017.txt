Ecle'tor's Preficve, v

MS.‚ but also in the MS. belonging to Pcmbrokc
College, Cambridge. It is one of the many pleasurcs
connected with this work that it has brought ine the
privilege of his friendship. In relation to the last-
named MS. Ι have to acknowledge 1110 courtesy of
the College Librarian, Mr. Neil.

At the British Museum my special thanks arc duc
to Mr. F. Bickley, not only for constant help in my
researcheS, but for sending me written information
on various points when I was prevented by illness
from going up to London myself. The Dean and
Chapter of Durham kindly allowed their MS. of Bede
to be deposited in the Bodleian for my use3 to them
and to their learned Librarian, Dr W. Greenwell, my
best thanks are due. Ι am also indebted to my
brother, Dr. A. Plummer‚ for verifying for me some
points which Ι had overlooked. A like service was
done me at VVinchester by the Librarian, the Rev.
F. T. Madge. My original examination of the Win-
chester MS. was made under the hospitable roof of
my dear friend, Dr. Kitchin‚ now transferred to a
sphere of wider usefulness at Durham. At Namur
special facilities were given me by the director and
librarian of the municipal library and museum,
M. Becket and M. Mahieu.

To the Delegates of the Clarendon Press I am in-
debted for entrusting me with the execution of this
edition, which has occupied my chief energies for
some four years. It is no light privilege to have
been for so long a time in constant communion with
one of the saintliest characters ever produced by the
Church of Christ in this island. Ι can but adapt the
words of St. Ignatius, and say: εὔχομαι μὴ εἰς μαρτύριον
αὐτὸ κτήσωμαι (Philad. C. 6).
