Bede in this connexion, and for him it means, not ‘the
outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace.⁸
but rather the 1111161· and spiritual meaning of an extcrnal

Had not St. Paul himself

declared that all things happened to Israel in a figure, and
were written for our admonition‘2‘? Did not 0111· Lord
Himself speak in parables to teach us 10 look below the
surface of things 3 ⁶? We must 1101 suppose that 3 writer

¹ ‘The word sacramcntmn in

or fact,'' more especially where
a deeper verity is hidden under
some familiar external form. . . .

sense of “a solemn 011118311011,

senses it was applicable 10 1116

latter sense it was more ap-
propriate to baptism.' Ltft.‚
App. Ff. II. i. 51. It is in the
former sense that Bede most
commonly uses it ; and especially
in the plural ; ‘altius sacramen-

‘cuius uectis si . . . sacramentum
scire desideras‚' ib. 301; viii.
2443 ‘patet sacramentum: i. e.
‘the inner meaning is plain7’

of 11301118 1116 1111161· significance
of proper names: ‘Felix . . .
iuxta sui nominis sacramentum?
H. E. ii. 15 adfin. So of Felix of
Nola: ‘nominis sui mysterium
