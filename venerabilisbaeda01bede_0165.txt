Chronologyy of Bede's Writl‘ngya cxlvii
p. 271, both the metrical and prose lives of Cuthbert are

said to have been written ⁴ ante annos plures '.’

Before 716. IN APOCALYPSIN ‘·'.

This must be earlier than 716 as it is dedicated to
Hwaetbert as ‘ Frater Eusebius ⁹—2'. c. before he became
abbot in 716 (v. s. pp. xiv, xv). It is earlier than the
In Acta. Opp. xii. 1. 337—341.

709 >< 716. IN AcfrAss.

This must be later than 709 as it is dedicated ‘Accae
Episcopo.’ Opp. xii. 1. It is earlier than the In Lucam,
which again is earlier than the In Samuelem, which was
written in 716. Also the preface speaks of Hwaetbert as
‘Frater Eusebius.' Ib. It was copied in great haste. Ib. 2.

⁵? 709 >< 716. IN EPISTOLAS CATHOLICAs4.

The Commentary on 1 John was sent with the In
Acta, Opp. xii. 4, and was therefore probably composed
about the same time.

709 >< 716. IN LUCAM ⁵.

See the last entry but one. The In Lucam seems to
have been followed next by the 111 Samuelem. Opp. vii.
369 ; viii. 146. Therefore it probably comes towards the
end of the period 709—716. It was written after the In.
Acta, x. 265 ; xii. 1, and after the In Apocalypsin,
x. 267, 269.
