cii Introduction. [PART 11.

from Egbert to Henry ΙΙΙ, and occupies ff. 1 a-4 b, come
the capitula of all the five books of the H. E. con-
secuffively, ff. 4c—7b; whereas in all other MSS. that
I have examined the capitula of each book immediately
precede that book. Further‚ at the end the beautiful
invocation ‘teque deprecor, bone Iesu. . . ante faciem
tua1n‚’ is omitted. This is not due to mutilation3 for
the H. E. ends on f. 101 3, and the remainder of ff. 101, 102
is occupied with other matter. In one or two points it
shows an affinity with N. Thus it omits 1116 clause:
‘gratulabatur 1116 . . . 831116116 est’ 31 1116 end of v. 22 3

‚ it agrees with N in the peculiar reading in V. 12, ‘postea

autem7⁷ 810. See p. 309, 11016 2. But as it 1136 not the
lacuna which in N immediately precedes that passage,
it cannot be a transcript of N3 and the same is true of
other peculiarities of N which are not shared by ΒΖ. But
apart from these points the text of the Η. Ε. 16 dis-
located in the 111061 extraordinary way ; and as the point-s

= of dislocation occur, not merely in the middle of a column,

but as a rule in the middle 01 3 11116, 1116 dislocation must
be due 10 1116 scribe having copied mechanically a MS.
in which the gatherings had been misbound, and one
gathering lost altogether. The text now occurs in the
following order. After the capitula (v. 3.) we have :
