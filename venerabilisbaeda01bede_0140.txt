cxxii Introduction. [PART 11.

The name of another possessor of it seems to occur:
‘Sam. Ooluile, Scotus.' This Charles Fairfax was
a son of the first Lord Fairfax, brother of the second,
and uncle of the third, the famous parliamentary
general. He was a barrister by profession, but in the
civil war he became a 90101191 01 1001; like his more
famous nephew he joined with Monk in the restoration
of Charles Π. Η9 died in 1673 (Fairfax Correspon-
dence, 1. lviii, f.). Some elegiae verses addressed to
him are on the flyleaf of the MS. 11 was by the be-
quest of his nephew, the great Lord Fairfax, that this
and other MSS. came to the Bodleian. It contains,
besides 1119 Η. E„ Cuthbert's letter on the death of Bede,
and Abbo of Fleury’s Passion of St. Edmund (imperfect)
prefaced by Abbo's well-known letter to Dunstan. Two
marginal notes 011 111. 27 911(1 111. 28 show the interest of
the Selby scribe in the ecclesiastical history of neighbour-
ing districts: ‘nota quod Lindissi insula proprium
habuerit episcopum 3⁹ ‘nota quod Hripensis ecclesia pro-
prium habuerit episcopum.’ The word ‘ papa’ has been
occasionally erased. It is a poor and uninteresting MS.

’ Ι 90111111119, 26·25><17·50, ff. 201, twelfth or thirteenth

century. Α poor and carelessly written MS. It contains,
besides theH. E„ the letter on the death of Bede, and Bede's
Commentary on the Catholic Epistles, the last being in
a different hand. It is mutilated at the beginning.

Of these three Μ88., Ο,Ο 911(1 Os, are O-texts with the
insertion 01 iv. 14. Ο14 1199 further the insertion of
‘cuius supra meminimus' in iv. 18. But in all three
the H. E. in the first hand ends abruptly with the words t
‘Martyrologium (19 11919119119,’ v. 24, p. 259, l. 15. This
is not due to mutilation, as in all three MSS. Cuthbert's
letter follows immediately, and the agreement cannot be
accidental. All three MSS. must therefore be ultimately
derived from some MS. in which a leaf had been lost
