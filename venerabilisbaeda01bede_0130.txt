cxii Introduction. [PAR'r ΙΙ.

3 pure C-text of the Winchester type is Balliol College7
Oxford, No. 176 (019). This is a twelfth-century MS„
folio, double columns, 36·50>< 2570, ff. 182. The H. E.
occupies ff. 1—93, the remainder being assigned to Bede’s
Commentary on St. Mark. It is all in one hand, and
well written, the initials finely illuminated in green and
red. Owing to the glaze of the vellum or the thickness
of the ink the writing has peeled off in many places,

On a fiyleaf at the beginning is the enti-y : ‘Liber
domus de Balliolo in Oxon. ex dono Willm. Gray Eliensis
episcopi.' William Gray was bishop of Ely, 14 54-1478.
They are no other marks of ownership.

Apart from the general characteristic-s of the Winchester
group, 019 15 specially connected with W by the adoption
in the text of the alternative beginning of v. 9 which W²
has written on the margin. The object of this alternative
was undoubtedly to make the passage more suitable for
reading aloud in church or in refectory¹ ; and that the
scribe of 019 had this object specially in view is shown
by the fact that he has actually given to ii. 1 the heading :
‘Lectiones quedam de uita uel obitu beati Gregorii pape,
edite a uenerabili Beda presbitero.' He would naturally
therefore prefer the alternative reading of W2 in v. 9.

The following are some of the- points in which W, 02,

e and 019 agree with one another against all other MSS.:

i. 8 begins (in the middle of a sentence) ‘ubi postea
redeunte,' p. 21, 1. 27, instead of ‘at ubi turbo‚' p. '223
ii. 2 begins ‘haec iuxta opinionem‚' p. 81, 1. 4, instead of
‘Interea Augustinus' in W and 0.1; in 019 there 15
3 large initial to ‘ haec‚' but a still larger one to ‘interea'
In iv. 1, p. 202, 1. 6, 1115 four oldest MSS. are divided
between ‘Niridano’ and ‘Hiridano' as the name of

of this custom. It is a frequent the custom of reading aloud at
cause of corruptions of the text refection‚ ib. 987.
