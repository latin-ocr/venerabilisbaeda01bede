details 3 but he has inserted others of his own, such as the
beautiful fal-ewell scene between Benedict and Sigsrid ¹.
He was of course much nearer to the facts here than iu
the case of Cuthbert; indeed of many things ho must
have been an eye-witness. And the Lives of the Abbots
are not unworthy to take their place beside the Ecclesi-
astical History. But it would have been matter for regret
had Bede’s works supplanted wholly the works of his
predecessors, The fewness of the MSS. in which these
works exist shows that this contingency was very near
ocem-ring2. And this brings home to us the possibility,
suggested many years ago by Lappenberg, that Bede’s
Ecclesiastical History may, by its very excellence, have
caused the loss of a large amount of earlier historical
materials3 ; a question which arises also in the case of our
Synoptic Gospels.

to which he himself no doubt assigned the great-est value {¹33³
are theological in character. These consist principally of
commentaries on books of the Old and New Testament 4.
There are also homilies and treatises which do not differ
very much from the commentaries‚ except in the fact
that they deal with detached, instead of with continuous,
portions of Scripture ⁵. Thus the homilies are expositions

illustrates this point that we
find among the homilies of Bede
in MSS. and. editions what are
simply extracts from his com-
mentaries. Thus Nos. 11 and 15
in 61105, Opp. V. 85 ff.‚ 103 ff. are
extracts from Bede on Mark and
Luke respectively. Opp. x, 114-
