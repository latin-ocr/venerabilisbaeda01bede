01 11157 relations, given to the most reverend Abbot Bene-
(1101, 311(1 afterwards to Ceolfrid‚ to be educated. From that
time I have spent the whole of my life within that monas-
tery, devoting all my pains to the study 01 1116 Scriptures 3
and amid the observance 01 11101135110 discipline and the
daily charge 01 singing in the Church‚ it has been ever my
delight to 163111, or 163011, or write 1. In my nineteenth
year 2 I was admitted to the (1130011316, 111 11157 thirtieth to
the priesthood‚ both by the hands 01 1116 111051 reverend
Bishop J 011113, and at the bidding of Abbot Oeolfrid. From
the time 01 my admission to the priesthood to my [present]
fifty-ninth year, 1 have endeavoured, for my own use and
that of my brethren‚ to make brief notes upon the holy
Scripture, either out of the works 01 1116 venerable fatherS,
or in conformity with their meaning and interpretation.'

Then after giving a list 01 1115 works, so far as, at that
date (731), they had been written, he concludes: ‘And
I pray thee, loving J esus, that as Thou hast graciously
given me to drink in with delight the words 01 Thy
knowledge, 50 Τ11011 wouldst mercifully grant me to attain
one day to Thee the fountain 01 311 wisdom, and to appear
for ever before Thy 1306 4.'
