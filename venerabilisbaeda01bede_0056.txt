Flood ; the second from the Flood to Abraham ; the third
from‘Abraham to David ; the fourth from David to the
Captivity of Judah3 the fifth from the Captivity to the
birth of Christ 3 the sixth age lasts until the day of J udge-
ment, and its duration is known to God alone¹. These
six ages, during which the faithful labour for God in this
world, correspond with the six days of God's labour in
the works of Creation. The seventh age, answering to
His sabbath rest, is that in which the souls of the faithful,
separated from their bodies, rest from their labours in the
unseen world, and is therefore contemporary with all the
other six, beginning when God's first martyr Abel was
slain, and lasting till the general resurrection, when the
souls of the faithful being united to their glorious bodies,
the eighth age beginS, which lasts for ever 2.

ξ 12. Of the historical works of Bede the most impor-

tant is the Historia Ecclesiastica Grenffls Anglorum 3. It is

viii. 12, 82, 231 3 De Templo, ib.
323. In Ezram et Nehem„ ib.
393, 3943 ix. 24. In Marcum,
x. 38, 39, 132. In Lucam, ib.
3203 xi. 6, 102, 185. In Acta,
xii. 49. In Epp. Cathol. xii.
255. [Cf. ib. 281, where there
is a different arrangement into
five periods corresponding to
the hours at which the labour-
ers in the vineyard were hired ;
the starting-points being Crea-
tion‚ Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Christ. This is practicallyEthel-
werd's system, who restores the
number six by inserting Solo-
mon between Moses and Christ.

i. 60, 66, 68, 78-81 <in this
last hymn the correspondence
of the six ages of the world with
the six days of Creation is very
beautifully worked out). Bede’s
system is found in Wulfstan,
