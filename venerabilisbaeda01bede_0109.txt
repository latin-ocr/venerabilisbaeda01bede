4. In the chronological summary, v. 24, the c-toxt
ends the annal 731 with the word ‘archiepiscopus’
omitting the words ί11011113. . . inperii ⁹ (p. 356). It then
embodies the 31111313 733, 734 <which in the M-text occur
in a sort of appendix after the close of the workl, after
which it proceeds with Bede’s notice of his life and
works.

5. In the list of Bede's works the C-text omits the
excerpts from Jerome on the Prophets: ‘In Isaiam . . .

The same phenomenon occurs, in the pure text MSS.
Thus in W and 01 1110 words ‘cuius supra meminimus'
(No. 3> have been inserted. In Ol the words ‘nonus . . .
inperii ' (No. 4) are inserted. Again in 0,, though iv. 14
is not actually inserted in the text there is a mark made
that something is wanting. These instances are interest-
ing as enabling us to trace the actual steps by which the
process of conflation took place. The most striking case
of this occurs 3130 in 01. This has the clause ‘Praeterea
omnes . . . inueniam’ at the end of the work (No. 1,
