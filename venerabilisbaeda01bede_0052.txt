xxxviii Introduction. [PART Ι.
Ι will quote one sentence. Speaking of the creation, he
says: ‘From the seeds and primordial causes of this

creation the' course of the whole world is evolved by
natural laws, wherein the Father worketh hitherto, and

the Son worketh, wherein also He feeds the ravens and
clothes the lilies1.' This thought, that the natural laws
by which the world is governed, and the natural processes
by which created things are sustained‚ are parts of the
revelation whereby God makes His working known, is

one which we hardly grasp sufficiently. We are too
much inclined to set God and nature in opposition to one

another, and to see the Divine only in the abnormal. As
Browning says :—
‘Thou, at the prompting· of what I call God,
And fools call nature 2.’
Of the two chronological works 3, which may form a fitting
transition from the scientific to the historical class, the
shorter, the De Temporibus, was written in 703, the longer,

are chiefly Isidore’s work with
the same title, and Pliny’s
Natural History, see VVerner,
pp. 107—121. On Isidore’s De
Nat. Rer. see D. C. B. iii. 310.
The whole article is most in-
teresting. The colophon of a MS.
of this work of Bede in the Cam-
bridge University Library, Gg.
ii. 21, acknowledges the obliga-
tion to Pliny. See Catalogue of
MSS. iii. 53. There is a dis-
sertation by Karl Welzhofer on
Beda’s Citate aus der Nat. Hist.
des Plinius. Munich, 1891. I
have not read it.

¹ ‘Ex eiusdem creaturae semi-
nibus et primordialibus causis
totius seculi tempus naturali
cursu peragitur, ubi Pater usque
nunc operatur, et Filius, ubi
etiam coruos pascit, et lilia ues-
tit Deus.5 Opp. vi. 1003 cf. a fine

passage from st. Augustine,
De Gen. ad litt. v. 23, cited by
Gore, Bampton Lectures, pp.
262, 263.

2 The Ring and the Book3
The Pope, vv. 1073, 1074.

3 On Bede's chronological
works and their sources—here
again largely Isidore—see Wer-
ner, pp. 121—149. In chronology
Bede has the enormous merit of
being the first chronicler who
gave the date from Christ’s
birth, in addition to the year of
the world ; and thus introduced
the use of the Dionysian Era
into WVestern Europe. VVerner,
p. 1453 Earle, Land Charters,
&c., pp. xxxi ff. It was not used
in papal documents till the
eleventh century. On it see De'
Temp. Rat. c. 47 ; Opp. vi. 239-

243.
