§3.] Bede's Life (cml Worlcs. xiii
Bede? Why comes 110 not to tho proscribffll ‹l‹·voti‹›11s
with the b1·ethre11¹‘?'” And in the commentary on

st.. Luke, he says : ‘Whenever we enter 1110 Churvh, and
draw near to 1116 heavenly mysterios, wc ought to approach
with all humility and fear, as well because of the pre-
sence of the angelic powers, as of the reverencc duc to
the sacred oblation 3 for as the angels are nari-rated to have
stood by the Lord’s body when it lay in the tomb, so wc
must believe that they are present in the celebration of
the mysteries of His most sacred body at the time of
consecration ².’ In the same spirit of devotion, comment-
ing 011 st. Mark's narrative, where our Lord, after the
triumpha] entry into Jerusalem, goes to the temple, he
says: ‘So We when we come to any town or village-in
which there is a house of prayer dedicated to God, first
turn aside to this, and, when we have commended our-
selves to God in prayer, then go about 1116 worldly busi-
ness for which we came 3.' And perhaps some of us 113176
known 1116 refreshment of entering the silence of 501116
great cathedral, or the quiet of some village church, after
a weary journey, or a dusty Walk, and there composing
our thoughts a. While in peace ⁴.
