followedby Cuthbcrt’s letter to Cuthwine on the death
of Bede, ff. 94 d—95 ; St. Bcrnard’s life of st. Malachias,
ff. 96-1 17 c ; Nennius, ff. 1 17 c—121 d, where it ends im-
perfectly. On the recto of the flyleaf, at the beginning,
is a list of Archbishops of York from Paulinus to
‘WVillehnus de Meltun, assumptus de aula regis ' <1316-
13403. To the name of ‘Henricus de Newerke, Iurista,
Decanus ecclesie' (1296—9) is appended the note: ‘et
tunc statutum in capitulo Ebor. quod nunquam deinceps
decanus ecclesie eligetur in archiepiscopum, ne forte
decanatus ecclesie uacantis daretur per summum ponti-
ficem, sicut contigit in ecclesia Lincolnie et alibi in
Anglia.’ Then after some verses comes the word:
‘Bi-icllington.' On the verso is the inscription: ‘Liber
Sancte Marie de Ioreualle <Jervaux)’; but the two last
words are written on an erasure, so that it had evidently
belonged to some other ‘ Saint Mary' previously¹; yet
the curse follows: ‘ quicunque librum istum alienauerit
anathema sit.' The Ms. came to the College ‘ex dono
uenerabilis uiri Guilielmi Laud, . . . Praesidis, et ecclesiae
Cathedralis Gloucestriae Decani. 1620.’

It is inscribed, ‘e libris Monasterii Sancti Germani de
Selby Com. Ebor. Chron. xii.’ There are inscriptions in
English and Latin showing that it was given in Sept.
1650 by Walter Cant, advocate of Edinburgh‚ to Colonel
Charles Fairfax. Before this it had belonged to ‘W.
Santclair of Roislin, Knecht3 Anno 1591, 2 Januarii.'
