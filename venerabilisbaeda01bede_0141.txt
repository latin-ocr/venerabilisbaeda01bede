before Cuthbert's letter, containing 1110 11151 paragraphs of
the H. E. In 0Η 1110 want was discovered, and the
missing paragraphs added affer the letter, including the
clause ‘propterea (sir) 01111105. . . 11111011111111.’ But as it
15 mutilated at the beginning we cannot be sure that that
01111150 may not have occurred also in the prefacc‚ as in
Η3 and Ar. This group shows a certain affinity With 1110
text of O„ but it is not directly derived from it.

§35 The next group of MSS„ A„ 06, 011, 012, 015, Ειηὼρτ
O17 (to which may be added O1 4, 117111011 for special reasons ἓζῗξζξωῃ
11115 been already described), show a further degree of
conflation of the C-text ; they not only insert iv. 14, but
have the words ‘ cuius supra meminimus' in the text of
iv. 18. Moreover, With 1110 exception of A„ they all
show more or less affinity 10 O„ though I cannot say
that any one of them 15 an immediate copy of that MS.
Within the group 011 15 closely related to, though not
a transcript of 017. As Α2 stands apart from the other
members of the group I take it first.

Additional, 14‚2 50 (A), small folio, 27·30 >< 1700, Additional,

ff. 150, thirteenth century. It was purchased for the ¹4’250(A²)'
Museum at the sale of Dean Milles’ library, April 15,
1843, f. 1 VO, and on the top margin of f. 31¹0 is the entry :
‘Liber domus Plympton.' On f. 2v0 is a pedigree of
Noah’s descendants. The H. E. occupies ff. 310-148 r0‚
the remaining ff. (148 V0—150V0) being taken up With
a short chronology from the Incarnation to 1 177⁷ though
the last entry is 1170, ‘Anglorum primas corruit ense
Thomas’ It agrees with O3 in a remarkable reading in
i. 27, p. 52, l. 10, the insertion of ‘ordinantur alii episcopi '
after ‘episcopi,' but it is not a transcript of 03, for in v. 2 1,
p. 344, note 5, 03 has supplied an omission of the 01οΧ1
111 115 own way, Whereas A2 has the correct reading ¹.

¹ The fact that this MS. uses Mr. Bradshaw’s theory, Col-
‘ finit’ and ‘ explicit’ indiscri- lected Papers, p. 459, that ‘finit’
minately at the end of the books as opposed to ‘explicit' is a
of the H. E. is rather against· specially Celtic use.
