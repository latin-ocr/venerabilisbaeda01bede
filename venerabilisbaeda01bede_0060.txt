mouth and J arroW, and the lives in verse and prose of
St. Cuthbert.

The lives of the abbots must have been written after
716. The prose Life of Cuthbert was written probably
about 720. Both in it and in the Lives of the Abbots, Bede
was making use of earlier lives, that ¹of Cuthbert by an

anonymous monk of Lindisfarne, that of the abbots by a
member of his own community of VVearmouth and Jarrow.

In the case of Cuthbert’s Life it cannot, Ι think, be said
that Bede has bettered his original. He has improved the
Latinity no doubt, and made the Whole thing run more
smoothly. In fact he seems to take delight in altering
the language for the mere sake of alteration, While keep·
ing closely to the sense. But he has obliterated many
interesting details of time ,and place ¹, he shows a marked
tendency to exaggerate the ascetic and miraculous ele-
ment, he amplifies the narrative With rhetorical matter
which can only be called padding 2, inserts as facts ex-
planations of his own3, and has greatly spoiled one
beautiful anecdote4. On the other hand, his account of
Cuthbert-'s death, derived from an eye-witness, is of real
and independent value ³.

In the Lives of the Abbots he more often abbreviates
than expands. Here too he has sacrificed some interesting

life, ἐς 8, 9, 13, 14, 25, 46. One
object of omitting proper names
of persons and places was to
make it more easy to read such
works in church or refectory.
It is for the same reason that

hand, and, what many of us can
sympathise with, the numerals
written out in full. In the
matter of proper names the life
of Columba by Cuimine shows
a striking absence of them as
compared with that byAdamnan,
which is partly based upon it.
