however one point of interest. It is the only MS„ as

Dean and Chapter of Durham, B. ii. 35 (D), at the head of
the latter the MS. belonging to the Dean and Chapter of

WVinchester, No. 3 (W). The chief point in which 111050- .

two groups agree with one another, and differ from O, is
the insertion of considerable additions in Bede’s chrono-
logical summary. (See the critical notes to v. 24.)
Further, both groups differ greatly from C, and from all
normal MSS. of whatever type, in the divisions between
the chapters ; the divisione being very unskilfully made.

not only differ strongly from O, but also from one
another. Hence we must conclude that the original
MS. from which these two groups are ultimately derived
(1) was closely related to O; (11) contained additional
matter 111 1110 chronological epitome; (iii) had the
divisions between the chapters marked very imperfectly
