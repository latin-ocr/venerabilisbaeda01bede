us do so.'' But when, as we were feasting and spending
the day in gladness, I began a third time to repeat the
same words of warning, then they understood that it was
not for nought that I was so insistent on this theme, and
in terror they said: “Let us do as thou advisest3 for
some great necessity is laid upon us of girding up our
spiritual loins to watch against the wiles of the Devil and
all temptations.'' And Ι, in saying this, knew no more
than they, that any special trial was about to assail us;
only I was admonished by some instinctive feeling that
we must ever fortify our hearts against the sudden,
storms of temptation. But when the next morning
they left me, and returned to their own monastery
of Lindisfarne, behold, they found that one of their
members had died 'of the plague3 which increased and
raged for days and months, unt-il within the year
almost the whole of that noble company of fathers and
brethren had departed to the Lord ¹.'

No doubt this monastic life had, like everything human,
its seamy side. Already in Bede's time a great relaxation
of discipline had set in in many monasteries 2, and the
infection spread after his death even to his own beloved
Wearmouth and Jarrow 3. From the frequent exhorta-
tions to peace and the avoidance of detraction 4 we can see
that quarrels among the brethren were not unknown 5.
