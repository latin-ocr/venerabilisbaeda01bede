The fact that the inserted matter has mainly to (lo
with Wilfrid shows that the origin of this MS. must be
northern. The key to the position lies in an entry under
the year 667: ᾗ abb. scri. (‘ noster abbas scripsit’).
Who was tho northern abbot about 667 whose Writings
were so important as 'co deservo a special entry‘? The
answer to that question would fix the locality of the
parent MS. of these two groups. The evident interest ln
Wilfrid suggests Hoxham, Ripon, York, or possibly
Lindisfarne ⁶? Can it refer to the Writing of the great
Lindisfarne Gospels by Eadfrid1? If SO, the date is
probably placed too early.

Of the two gronps, ‘the D group is much nearer ‘co O
than the W group. This is not surprising, seeing that
I have already given reasons for believing that C itself is
a Lindisfarne or Durham book. This greater nearness
of D to G is shown by tho fairly numerous instances in
which they agree together against W. The following
may serve as specimens ε ‘itaque,’ G, D, p. 42, note 4, ‘ iam-
que,' W; ‘conue1·sione,’ O, D, p. 106, note 3, ‘conuersa-
tione,' W3 ‘oognosounlsun⁹ C, D, p. 84, note 3, ‘noscuntur-st

‘uocatur,’ O, D, p. 286, note 7, ‘uocabatur,' W3 ‘institu-
tionis,’ O, D, p. 332, note 3, ‘institutis,’ W.

For this reason I take the Durham group first in order.

Cathedral Library (B. ii. 3 5). The other members of the ham gr‘'¹¹¹'‘
group are Harl. 4124 (H2); C. C. 0., Oxon. 279 (ΟΝ),

The bulk of the MS. is of the twelfth century. But
a certain number of fifteenth-century tracts are bound up
in it. This juxtaposition mush, however, have taken
