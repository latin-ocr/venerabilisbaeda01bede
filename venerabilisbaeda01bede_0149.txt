Bede’s collected works, which was itself rcprinted 1688.
In 1681 Chifflet the Jesuit published his edition of
Bede’s H. Ε. under the title ‘Bedae Presbyteri et F redc-
garii scholastici concordia,' 4to, Paris For this he used
‘S. Maximini Treuerensis codex peruetustus ¹,’ a MS.
which Hardy2 identifies with MS. Phillips, 1873, and
believes to be a transcript of M. Certainly Chifflet's text
is of the M-type. At the end of the work, after ‘faciem
tuam,' Chifflet gives from the printed editions the
continuation of Bede’s Chronology. This he believes
to be mainly the work of Bede himself, whose death he
places in 762 (1). In addition to these continental editions,
Griles3 mentions an edition of the H. E. at Lyons in 1587,
and collected editions os Bede’s works at Paris in 1544
and 1554. Hardy 4 further gives the following editions ε
1483, Strasburg3 1493, Spires3 1514, Strasburg3 1545,
Paris3 1661, Cologne ⁵.

In 164 3—4 Abraham VVhelock published, at Cambridge,
the first English edition of the Latin text of the H. E„
and the editio princeps of the Anglo-Saxon version. He
probably took his Latin text mainly from one of the
continental editions, but he used also three MSS„ one
belonging to Sir Robert Cotton, one to Dr. Ward of
Sidney Sussex College, and one to Trinity College,
Cambridge ⁶. In 1722 appeared Smith's edition, already
described, which at once superseded all others.

Saxon version, the earliest is by Thomas Stapleton, &effigium
