vi Editor's Prefczce. ⁸

In the Dedieabion I have tried to exp1·eSS‚ imper-
feefflyyenough2 obligations of a more general kind to
those College friends to whom I have owed so much
happiness during more than a quarter of a century of
College life. Will they allow me to close this prefaee
with the words wit-,h which Ceolfrid parted from his
monks (p. 397): ‘ Domine . . . protege illam eohortem!
Seio autem certissime quia nullos umquam meliores
illis . . . noui ’2
