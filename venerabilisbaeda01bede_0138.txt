cxx Introduction. [PART 11.

With this exception the MS. is, as Ι have shown
above (pp. cxi-cxiii), a transcript of W.

Stowe 104 [old number 863]‚ quarto, 2575 >< 17-65‚
ff. 149, twelfth century. It is mutilated at the beginning,
wanting the Preface and the Capitula to Book i 3 but the
clause ‘Propterea (sic) omnes . . . inueniam ⁹. occurs at the
end 3 and in other respects it exhibits the C-text with the
addition of iv. 14, and the insertion (above the line) of
the words ‘ cuius supra meminimus ³ in iv. 18. At v. 2,
p. 284,1. 10, 1110 scribe has omitted all after the words
‘syllabas ac uerba' to the end of v. 5, p. 289. The H. E.
ends on f. 112 a⁷ and is followed by the letter on the
death of Bede ; then after some verses on the Arch-
bishops of Canterbury1 from Augustino to Iaenbert,
ff. 113 b-114 a, comes the omitted portion of the H. E..
ff. 1 14 a—1 15 b, followed by some sections from Folcard’s
life of st. John of Beverley‚ ff. 1 15b-1 17a 3 then Ailred's
life of Edward the Confessor, ff. 118 a-149 a 3 f. 149 b is
occupied with the beginning of Hugo [‘? de S. Victore}
De uirginitate Sancte Marie. The special interest in
st. John of Beverley suggests a northern origin for this
MS. ‚ but beyond that I can say nothing. The word ‘papa ’
is frequently eiQased

desessed' [deceased] The H. E. ends, unmutilated‚ on
f. 130 r0‚ with the words ‘superadicere curaui,' v. 24, p. 357,
l. 9 from bottom, omitting the list of Bede's works and
all that follows. Hence the clause ‘Praeterea omnes . . .
inueniam' does not occur in this MS. at all. It is pos-
sible that the scribe had an incomplete copy of the type of
the three next MSS„ and thought it better to conclude here
than in 1110 middle of a sentence. The H. E. is followed
