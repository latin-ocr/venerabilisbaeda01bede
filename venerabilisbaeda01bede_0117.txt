A beautiful MS. It belonged formerly to the monastery
of St. Georgenberg, near Schwatz, ΓΓΥ1·01; and 011 tho
reverse of the last leaf is an entry relative to St. Gom-gv
of Cappadocia. Owing to the loss of a leaf noar the ond

tests 4 and 5 cannot be applied3 but the other 111100
show it to be a MS. of the M-type.

In the Bibliotheca Casinensis, vol. iv, two MSS. 0111013013-

Bede’s H. E. are described, numbered 181 and 177
respectively; the former belonging to the first, the latter
to the second half of the eleventh century. J udged by
test No. 1, which is the most decisive, they belong to
the M-elass1. They agree with one another in a very

I have met with nowhere else. Probably, therefore,
the later MS. is a transcript of the earlier. But of this
I cannot speak positively, not having seen the MSS.

Hardy, but Ι think this is a good deal too early. Hardy
was perhaps influenced by the fact that the metrical
chronology which precedes the Hist. Eccl. and is in the
same hand as the rest of the MS., only comes down to
Henry 111². But this need only prove that the MS. from
Which this was copied was not earlier than 1216. On
f. 63 v'¹ in a hand of the sixteenth century is written: ‘In

nomine Dei. Amen. I George fforlonge of Wexforde..

tests given above this MS. belongs to the M-class; but
within that class it stands quite by itself. After the
