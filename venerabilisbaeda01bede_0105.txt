ς 2 5·] The illcmuscre’pta xci

There is a faesimile of a page of this MS. iu M. ΙΙ. B.
(plato xxvi).

ξ 25. Β (γε’. 5.), eighth century, folio, double columns, Cotton.
ff. 200. It wants the preface and capitula of the first ΞΞΞῘἽΒῨ
book at the beginning. and ends at the word ‘regnabat'
in the year 709 of the chronological summary, v. 24.
These losses are due to the great Cottonian fire of 17 31,
in which this MS. suffered severely ¹. Owing to this fact
also the original size of the MS. and its gatherings cannot
be given; and all evidence as 10 its history has been
destroyed. This is the more to be regretted‚ as the MS.
is of great interest. The writing is of the same general
character as that of G, but more pointed ². The initials
of the chapters are illuminated‚ and larger illuminations
mark the beginnings of the books. Contractions are less
frequent than in M. It has been corrected all the way
through by a scribe who had either C or a sister MS. to C
before him. Many pages of the critical notes will supply
evidence of 111163. This is the case even when the
readings of O are clearly inferior to those of B ⁴. It has
the same mode of marking documents as M. This is one
of many points which prove that B is a sister MS. to M 5.

They have not only the same type of text, but they agree

1 It was this burnt condItion
of the MS. which led me to use

the symbol B for 11, as a sort of

‘memoria technica.' Hence it
is not safe to argue from the
silence of the critical notes as
10 1116 readings of B. Large por-
tions of it are totally destroyed,
others are illegible.

² A facsimile of a very small
portion of this MS. is in Steven-
son’s edition.

⁵ That it is no light coinci-
dence may be judged from the
fact that Mr. VVarner, of the
MS. Department of the British
Museum, whose acquaintance
with Latin MSS. is unrivalled,
stated, when his attention was
called to this point, that he did
not remember to have seen this
peculiarity in any other MS.
