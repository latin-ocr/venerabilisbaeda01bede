in many minute particulars which cannot be accidental:
‘loeti' for ‘leti,’ p. 79, note 2 , ‘ciuitas’ for ‘ciuitatis,’
p. 94, note 1 , ‘eandem' for ‘eundem,' p. 100, note 2,
‘ob ⁷ for ‘ab,' p. 105, note 2 , ‘misserant ' for ‘miseranh’
p. 137, note 33 ‘patefactum' for ‘patefactan1,' p. 166,

‘sortibus' for ‘consortibus,⁷ p. 294, note 13, &c On the
other hand, neither of these MSS. is derived from the
011101, each has peculiarities of its own, B does not
abbreviate the quotations as does Μ, and what is more
decisive, each has omissions which are not found in the
other. For omissions in Μ Which are not found in Β 000
pp. 16, 11010 1, 68, 11010 3, 92, 11010 2, 124, 11010 6,
129, 11010 4, 143, 11010 1, 151, 11010 4, 810. For omissions
in B which are not in Μ <and these are 111010 considerable)
see ay. pp. 169, 11010 5, 172,11010 3, 275, 11010 33 v. 16,
17, and notes. Hence it follows that both MSS. must be
'copied from a common original.

As soon as this fact 10 realised, it becomes plain that
we can no longer take M as the sole basis of our text.
VVhere M and B agree we may presume that we have
the text of their common original , 27. e. we have 1110
testimony 1101 of two independent MSS. but really of
a single MS., though a MS. more ancient than any which
we possess, and which cannot be very far removed from
an autograph of Bede. VVhere however M and B differ,
we cannot straightway award 1110 palm 10 Μ, We must
either decide by internal evidence, or we 111001 01111 111

I attach very great importance 10 1110 agreement of either
M or E with C. For C, as Ι shall show, contains a different
recension of the text from M and Β, and 10 therefore
a wholly independent witness. And it will be found,
Ι think, that where M and B differ, C more often agrees
with B than with Μ, 111 011101 words, where they differ
B is more often right than M. Hence B has at least an
