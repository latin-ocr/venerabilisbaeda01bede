‘After this, still in AEdelehn’s hand. are twelve hexa-
meters beginning “Summe (for Sume) pater placidus
modulantis nota poete.’' They form the preface to a
poem addressed to Egbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne (803—
821) by AEthelwulf. . . ,The verses end at the bottoni
of the page, and no doubt the whole poem followed on
leaves now missing. There is however reason to believe
that they are in the British Museum in MS. Cott. Tib. D.
iv. ff. 309—318. These leaves, which have nothing to do
with the rest of the MS. (Lives of Saints of the twelfth
cent.) with which they are bound up, contain the poem
of AEthelwulf, without the prefatory lines, and beginning
at the top of the page. Allowing for the injury done to
them by the fire of 1 731, they are of the same dimensions
as the Winchester MS„ and the hand . . . appears to be
identical with that of the lines in the latter volume.'

Ι cannot see that there is anything which throws light
on the history of the MS. Dr. Kitchin thought that it
had been originally a Glastonbury book ¹. Οἳ, as Ι shall
show presently, is a transcript of this MS„ though, owing
to the insertion in it of iv. 14, Ι am obliged to place it in
the class of conflate MSS. 3 but as regards origin, Ο2 and
derivatives of O, «if any), must be reckoned as belonging
to the Winchester group.

The only other MS. which Ι can place here as exhibiting (Igilgiol 176

in 9233 unless we suppose
that that inscription also may

in apposition to ‘dont-erchin-
nach.’ Then the translation

would run : ‘ There is due to the
prior, viz. to william, the bene-
diction ’ &c. In any case, if the
MS. came from Glastonbury, the
Irish connexions of that monas-
tery receive an interesting il-
lustration, as Dr. Moore remarks.
I cannot think the MS. is so
ancient asto enable us to identify
the scribe with AEthelm who be-
came archbishop of Canterbury

have been copied from an older

MS.
1 For additional information

as to this MS„ I am indebted
to the Rev. F. Madge. In a
Glastonbury Catalogue of 1247,
we find ‘Historiae Anglorum

scriptae a Beda, bon. set uetust! ;
also, ‘ Beda de gestis Ang101-um.’
