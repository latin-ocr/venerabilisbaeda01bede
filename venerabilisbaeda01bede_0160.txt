cxlii Introduction. [PART 11.

of the fifteenth century, ff. 354. It contains theological
works‚ chiefly of Hugh of St. Victor and St. Augustine‚
and is written in a very small and contracted hand,
very difficult to read. Ff. 285 a—301 a contain six letters
of Bede, of which that to Egbert is the last, occupying
ff. 296 b-301 a. This MS. was consulted by Dr. Griles
for his edition of Bede’s workS‚ and annot-ations by
him wil-l be found ron the margin; from it he pub-
lished for the first time the third letter of the series ‘ad
Helmualdum de bissexto ’ (see above, Part 1, p. xxxvii),
the substance of which Bede afterwards incorporated in
the De Temporum Ratione (Opp. vi. 222). The Merton
MS. was the only one known to Smith (preface>⁷ though
he did not follow its readings in all respects. Stevenson
and Moberly simply reprinted Smith’s text. The letter
to Egbert was first published by Sir J ames Ware, Dublin‚
1664, 8vo, from whose edition it was reprinted by Whar-
ton: ‘Bedae . . . opera quaedam Theologica . . . necnon
Historica,' &c. ‚ 4to Lond. 1693. Wharton confesses in his
preface that he had seen no MS. of it. There can be no
doubt that Ware printed it from H. His text agrees
with H in all points in which H differs from M. It may
be sufficient to mention two instances3 it gives the
quotation at the end of ξ 7 in the abbreviated form of
H, and it gives the date at the end (pp. 411, note 3 ; 423,
note 4).

There can be no doubt that the text of H is on the
whole very superior to that of M, as might be expected
from its much greater antiquity. But in some instances
M has preserved a better reading. By a comparison of
the two MSS. I have been able I hope to give an im·
proved text; but it were much to be wished that some
additional MSS. might be discovered. For my know-
ledge of the existence of H I was indebted in the first
instance to the reference in H. δε S. iii. 326.
