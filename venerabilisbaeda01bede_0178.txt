clviii Introduction: Appewdfioe I.

Church ¹. Evil deeds, the imagination of which may
perhaps have dimly fioated through our minds in our
darkest moments, are here tabulated and reduced to
system. It is hard to see hoW any one could busy him-
self With such literature and not be the worse for it.

DE TONITRUIS,

Opp. iv. 343—348, is a most contemptible work, and
clearly spurious.

DE MINUTIONE SANGUINIS.

Less obviously spurious, and might possibly be by
Bede. Ib. 349—352 ; cf. H. E. v. 3.

DE Scmsmmssos.

Mentioned in Giles's second Life. Opp. Ι. clxii. This
is probably a mere mistake of scribe or printer for De
SchematibUS‚ on Which see above, p. cxlv.

CUGULUS, sIVE VERIS ET HIEMIS CONFLICTUS.

A hexameter poem, a sort of eclogue—unlike any of

A hexameter poem. Certainly spurious. Opp. i. 38—49.

MARTYRoLoemM POETICUM.

A hexameter poem. Certainly spurious. It mentions

50-53. Werner, however, accepts it as genuine, treating
the verses on Wilfrid as an interpolation (pp. 102, 146).
