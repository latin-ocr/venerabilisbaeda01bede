cxlvi· Introduction: Appenclioe I.

703. DE TEMPORIBUS.
708. EPIsToLA AD PLEewiNUM APOLOGETICA DE SEX AETA-
TIBUS SAECULI.

The dates of these two works are mutually dependent,
and therefore they must be considered together. The latter
is addressed to Plegwin, a monk of Hexham ¹, in answer to
an absurd charge of heresy which had been brought against
Bede ‘a lasciuientibus rusticis . . . per pocula,' in con-
nexion with the De Temporibus, Opp. i. 144. This, he
says, was written ‘ante quinquennium.' Ib. 145. And
he begs that his defence may be read ‘coram uenerabili
Domino . . . Wilfrido antistite.' The latter must there-
fore fall within the period 705 >< 709, during which Wil-
frid recovered the See of Hexham2. (H. E. v. 19 and
notes.) At the end of the De Temporibus Bede says:
‘Tiberius dehinc quintum egit annum.’ Opp. vi. 138.
Tiberius ΙΙΙ <Apsimarus) seized the throne in 6983 his
fifth year therefore is 702—3. At the beginning of the
chapter Bede says: ‘Sexta aetas continet annos prae-
teritos DccvnI ' ; this is a mistake for Doo 111, the v being
wronglyinserted. Both these dates, viz. the fifth year of
Tiberius and the date 703 A. D., occur in c. 14 of the work,
Opp. vi. 130, a passage which seems to have been over-
looked. This, then, is the date of the De Temporibus,
and the Letter to Plegwin is fixed to 708.

Before 705. VITA METRICA CUDBERCTI.

This must be earlier than 705 as it speaks of Aldfrid of
Northumbria as still alive : ‘nostrum regit inclitus
orbem,' c. 21 ad fin„ Opp. Min. p. 25. The De Tem-
porum Ratione, composed in 725, speaks of it as written
‘ante aliquot annos.' Opp. vi. 329. In H. E. iv. 26 [28],
fecerant, ipse per alphabetum 2 We see here fresh evidence
