xxviii Introduction. [PAR-r 1.
tioned from time to time in the canon of the Mass, at the
words: ‘Remember also, Lord, thy servants and hand-
maids‚ N. and N„ who have gone before us with the sign
of saith, and sleep the sleep of peace. To them, O Lord,
and to all who rest in Christ, grant, we beseech Thee,
a place of refreshment, light, and peace, through the same
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen ¹.' And Bede himself
tells us how we ought to embrace all, both living and
dead, in one common charity ².

Mutual hospitality between all monasteries seems to
have been regarded as a matter of ,course ; and Bede sees
in this one fulfilment of Christ's promise, that those who
forsake earthly possessions and relations for His sake,
shall receive an hundredfold even in this present world 3.
The guest-house or hospice was a separate building,
and the head of this department, the ‘ Praepositus
Hospitum,’ was an important officer of the community 4.

The discipline of the monastery was in the hands of
the abbot, assisted by the prior, or, as he was then called,

‘provost,' ⁴ praepositus ⁵.' Implicit obedience to the
